The girl has been charged as a juvenile, she said.\n\nWhen the first off-duty officer, 33, saw that the other officer was being attacked, he ordered the group to stop and identified himself as a police officer, holding up his badge in one hand and keeping the other near his firearm, Scaduto said. The officer then pulled out his gun and ordered the group to go back to their vehicles, she said.\n\nA third off-duty police officer, who was in a barbershop nearby with his son, came onto the street to intervene, Scaduto said, along with a sergeant in uniform who police said was driving to work in Morgan Park.\n\nThree witnesses \u2014 including a Chicago fire battalion chief \u2014 saw Joshua Beal go into a black Dodge Charger, grab a gun from the back seat and point it at the 33-year-old off-duty officer, Scaduto said.\n\n\"You're not the only (expletive) out here with guns,\" someone in Beal's group allegedly yelled.\n\nBeal then pulled the trigger, but the gun didn't fire, Scaduto said. Cellphone video captured Joshua Beal waving the weapon back and forth, she said, and the battalion chief saw him pull back the gun's slide, causing bullets to fall out. Two loose rounds were found after the shooting, prosecutors said.\n\nAccording to Scaduto, Beal ignored repeated orders from the 33-year-old officer and sergeant to drop the weapon.\n\nBoth fired their weapons, striking Beal, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.\n\nIn court Tuesday, Michael Beal \u2014 a mechanic who has no criminal record, according to his attorney \u2014 was still dressed for a funeral in a black shirt and pants. Spector called the $500,000 bail \"extremely high\" and said that Beal's family would be unable to come up with the money."}]}], [{"story_id": 1, "articles": [{"image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/11/08/Others/Images/2016-11-07/hrc411478574010.jpg", "summary": "He recounted the story of Edith Childs, the Greenwood, S.C., city councilwoman who coined the 2008 Obama campaign slogan, \u201cFired Up!\nOn the last day of the presidential campaign, Clinton seemed to be a clear but not overwhelming favorite.\n(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton made their final pitches to an anxious nation Monday, with Clinton seeking to strike a conciliatory, positive tone \u2014 and Trump, the underdog, warning of \u201cdisaster\u201d if he loses.\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton traveled across the United States on Nov. 7, holding final rallies in swing states before election day.\nIn making his last campaign appearances as president, he tried to help Clinton win the office he\u2019d denied her eight years before.", "title": "Trump, Clinton make final pitches to an anxious nation as moment of truth arrives", "created_at": 1478494800.0, "keywords": ["truth", "nation", "anxious", "campaign", "rally", "states", "obama", "day", "polls", "final", "trump", "arrives", "election", "moment", "win", "clinton", "pitches"], "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-clinton-make-final-pitches-to-an-anxious-nation-as-moment-of-truth-arrives/2016/11/07/7584dcba-a4ff-11e6-8fc0-7be8f848c492_story.html", "text": "Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton traveled across the United States on Nov. 7, holding final rallies in swing states before election day.

He said the country was on a downward slope, hampered by a favor-trading political elite and a mismanaged economy. His opponent was corrupt.

He returned to themes familiar from his run to victory in the Republican primaries, attacking the news media as corrupt and protective of Clinton.\n\nThese were the last rallies for Trump, the last gatherings of an unexpected movement that had begun with his ride down the escalator at Trump Tower in summer last year. The last crowds of Trump\u2019s campaign were boisterous, reflecting the GOP nominee\u2019s anger and magnifying it. They broke into shouts aimed at Clinton: \u201cLock her up!\u201d\n\nIn Raleigh, when Trump mentioned President Obama, some yelled out the same for the president: \u201cLock him up!\u201d The atmosphere grew especially rowdy at a late afternoon stop in Scranton, Pa., where shouts of \u201cShe\u2019s a demon!\u201d and \u201cShe\u2019s a witch!\u201d could be heard as Trump lambasted Clinton.\n\nAt a rally in Raleigh, N.C., Nov. 7, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said it would be a different story if the United States had debt but was in \"tippy top shape.\" But instead, Trump said \"everything\" from roads to schools to hospitals in the country is \"a mess.\" (The Washington Post)\n\nClinton was scheduled to be in several states, making two stops in Pennsylvania and a stop here in Michigan, before planning to end the day with a midnight rally in Raleigh, N.C.\n\nPresident Obama also made four stops \u2014 events that ended a chapter in his political career. Obama had begun his rise to the White House by defeating Clinton, the clear favorite, in the 2008 Democratic primaries.\n\nIn making his last campaign appearances as president, he tried to help Clinton win the office he\u2019d denied her eight years before. \u201cI am asking you to trust me on this one,\u201d Obama said at a stop in Ann Arbor, Mich.\n\nLater in the day, in the college town of Durham, N.H., Obama grew reflective, noting it was his final solo rally as president.\n\nHe recounted the story of Edith Childs, the Greenwood, S.C., city councilwoman who coined the 2008 Obama campaign slogan, \u201cFired Up! Ready to Go!\u201d \u2014 the same story he told at his last rally on the eve of his first election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not often you have a chance to shape history. The world is watching us,\u201d the president told thousands of cheering supporters who filled an arena at the University of New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cThis is one of those moments,\u201d Obama added. \u201cDon\u2019t let it slip away.\u201d\n\nLater in the evening, Clinton held a massive rally with more than 33,000 supporters outside Independence Hall in Philadelphia, featuring a performance by rock-and-roll icon Bruce Springsteen. Clinton told that crowd that \u201cevery issue that you care about is at stake.\u201d\n\nJoined by former president Bill Clinton, their daughter, Chelsea, President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama, the Democratic nominee pivoted away from the email controversy that dogged much of her campaign, casting the election as a choice \u201cbetween division and unity.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe choose to believe in a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America,\u201d she said.\n\nMichelle Obama, widely regarded as Clinton\u2019s most effective surrogate, spoke emotionally about the prospect of electing the first female president.\n\n\u201cSpeaking here tonight is the last and most important thing I can do for my country as first lady,\u201d she said.\n\nWarning that presidential campaigns are \u201cbreathtakingly close,\u201d Obama declared that the election \u201cis in our hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we get out and vote tomorrow, Hillary Clinton will win,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if we stay home or we play around with a protest vote, then Hillary\u2019s opponent will win. Period, end of story.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Trump held a rally in Manchester, N.H. \u2014 scene of his first primary victory \u2014 in which he returned to themes of his aggressive primary campaign. He attacked the media. He called Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic senator from nearby Massachusetts, \u201cPocahontas.\u201d He talked up his crowd size: \u201cHillary can\u2019t fill a room. Look at this, look at this, this is called filling a stadium,\u201d Trump said, in an arena that seats less than 12,000. He then told the crowd he had received support from New England Patriots star Tom Brady and the team\u2019s coach, Bill Belichick.\n\n[Among the few winners of this bitter election: The Obamas]\n\nPolls will open across the country Tuesday morning, and the first polls will begin to close at 6 p.m. Eastern time. Although millions of Americans voted before Election Day, there were still some key states \u2014 notably Pennsylvania and New Hampshire \u2014 where nearly all voting will take place on Tuesday. Those states got special focus from both camps on Monday.\n\nFor Trump, his message Monday was heavily influenced by the big news from the day before, when FBI Director James B. Comey said the bureau had completed its examination of newly discovered emails belonging to a Clinton aide \u2014 an examination that had roiled the presidential race when it was first revealed last month. He said there was nothing in the emails to change the bureau\u2019s months-old decision not to seek charges against Clinton, the former secretary of state, for using a private email server to conduct government business.\n\nTrump, who had been trailing badly in many polls when the new emails were revealed, has since narrowed the gap, leaning on a message that Clinton was \u201ccrooked\u201d and likely to be charged. On Monday, Trump changed his message about the emails, but only slightly \u2014 adding Comey to his target list for criticism.\n\nAt a midafternoon rally in Raleigh, N.C, where a supporter held up a sign reading, \u201cComey You\u2019re Fired,\u201d Trump said the FBI director was \u201cobviously under tremendous pressure\u201d to conclude the inquiry.\n\nAt the same rally, Trump painted a bleak picture of an America under Clinton, warning of imminent \u201cdisaster,\u201d a hobbled economy and politics dominated by special interests.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to the American people to deliver the justice that we deserve at the ballot box tomorrow,\u201d he declared. \u201cWe\u2019re going to win.\u201d\n\n\u201cDrain the swamp!\u201d his supporters chanted moments later.\n\nIn the last few days of the campaign, Trump has invested time and resources in blue-leaning states, including Minnesota, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Most recent opinion polls show Clinton leading in all three, but Trump is hoping for a surge among white voters who lack college degrees.\n\n[She was born the day women got the vote. And then a century passed. . .]\n\n\u201cThe miners are going to come out. The steelworkers who lost their jobs are going to come out,\u201d Trump said Monday. He said that polls showing him behind were simply rigged. \u201cThe women are going to come out big. It is all a phony deal. They are telling you a lot of phony stuff.\u201d\n\nTrump also claimed \u2014 without presenting any evidence \u2014 that he was doing better than expected among African Americans and Hispanics.\n\nIn fact, there are signs that strong Hispanic turnout could provide a big boost to Clinton. Polls have shown black and Hispanic voters overwhelmingly favor Clinton, and Clinton\u2019s campaign has touted heavy turnout among Hispanic and Asian Americans in early voting in Florida, Nevada and North Carolina.\n\nMore than 6.4 million voters in Florida have voted early, up nearly 35 percent over 2012, according to the Clinton campaign, with big early surges in majority-Hispanic \u00adMiami-Dade County.\n\n\u201cWe are on the path to see more Americans vote than we have ever seen in our history,\u201d Clinton said in Pittsburgh. \u201cIf the lines are long tomorrow, please wait.\u201d\n\nClinton made no mention of the conclusion of the FBI\u2019s email investigation during her campaign appearances.\n\nIn a TV interview, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook criticized Comey\u2019s handling of the probe as \u201cbizarre.\u201d\n\n[For FBI, email investigation yields little but criticism]\n\n\u201cWe were glad obviously that this was resolved,\u201d Mook told ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t understand why he couldn\u2019t have just looked into the matter and resolved it and not created such a ruckus in the campaign, but we\u2019re just glad in this last day Hillary can get back on the road.\u201d\n\nAt her events, Clinton assailed Trump, ticking through the groups of people she said the businessman and reality TV star had targeted or offended. Clinton also criticized Trump for apparently paying no federal income taxes for several years and for refusing to release copies of his tax returns.\n\n\u201cThere must be something really terrible in there,\u201d she said in a mocking tone.\n\nThe Justice Department said Monday that it would deploy more than 500 poll watchers from its Civil Rights Division to monitor voting in 67 jurisdictions in 28 states, including at least three in each of the swing states. Many of the jurisdictions have large Native American, black, Latino and Muslim populations.\n\nThe department said its lawyers would be working to enforce federal voting rights laws \u201cto ensure that every eligible person that wants to do so is able to cast a ballot.\u201d It also has a hotline (toll free at 1-800-253-3931 or 202-307-3931) to register complaints.\n\nSullivan reported from Raleigh.

(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nFBI Director James B. Comey said Sunday that the bureau had completed its examination of newly discovered emails connected to Hillary Clinton \u2014 an inquiry that had roiled the presidential race for nine days \u2014 and found nothing to alter its months-old decision not to seek charges against the former secretary of state for her use of a private email server.\n\nIn a letter to congressional committee chairmen, Comey said investigators had worked \u201caround the clock\u201d to review the emails. The investigators found that the emails were either duplicates of correspondence they had reviewed earlier or were personal emails that did not pertain to State Department business, government officials said.\n\nThe emails were on a computer used by former congressman Anthony Weiner \u2014 the estranged husband of longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin \u2014 that was seized during an FBI investigation into lewd text messages that Weiner (D-N.Y.) is alleged to have sent to a 15-year-old girl.\n\nIn late October, Comey said that some of the emails on the computer, sent or received by Abedin, may have been \u201cpertinent\u201d to an FBI investigation of a private server that Clinton used to conduct government business.\n\nOn Sunday, however, Comey said that after reviewing emails on the computer, \u201cwe have not changed our conclusions expressed in July.\u201d\n\nA Clinton spokeswoman on Sunday made a brief statement to reporters on the Democratic nominee\u2019s plane: \u201cWe are glad to see that . . . he has confirmed the conclusions that he reached in July,\u201d Jennifer Palmieri said of Comey. \u201cWe are glad that this matter is resolved.\u201d\n\nThis summer, Comey had ended an FBI probe into the server by saying that although he believed Clinton was \u201cextremely careless\u201d with classified information in the emails, Comey felt that \u201cno reasonable prosecutor\u201d would recommend criminal charges.\n\nOne of the government officials said Comey\u2019s letter on Sunday was not an \u201cinterim report\u201d but rather represented a conclusion of the investigation.\n\nSo, after nine days of uncertainty, the FBI\u2019s investigators had ended where they began.\n\nIn the meantime, however, much had changed.\n\nComey \u2014 a nine-day hero to some on the right \u2014 was now under criticism from both sides, for jumping into the late stages of a presidential race and then trying to jump back out.\n\nThe FBI itself had been drawn into partisan politics, as leaks revealed internal fights between agents and prosecutors squabbling over proposed investigations of the Clinton family.\n\n1 of 48 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail View Photos The Democratic presidential nominee on the road as Election Day nears.

Melina Mara/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\n\nThe presidential race had also been altered.\n\nRepublican Donald Trump, who had been trailing badly in the polls when the new emails were revealed, had since narrowed the gap, leaning on a message that Clinton was \u201ccrooked\u201d and likely to be charged.\n\nClinton, who had been trying to expand the electoral map by focusing on red states that included Georgia and Arizona, drew back to defend blue turf like Michigan and Pennsylvania. In those days, millions of votes were cast.\n\nIn Colorado, for instance, voters submit their ballots by mail. Daniel Cole, a Republican strategist in the state, said the number of Democrats returning ballots had been surging past the GOP total \u2014 until Comey announced his inquiry.\n\nThen, on Friday, the GOP total actually eclipsed the Democrats.\n\n\u201cThere was an enthusiasm gap,\u201d Cole said. \u201cUntil the latest bend in the email scandal, the wind was kind of out of our sails.\u201d\n\nAcross the country, Clinton remained a clear favorite in the race, even before Comey\u2019s announcement that the new inquiry was over.\n\nClinton led by two to five points in national surveys, held narrow polling leads in a slew of swing states, and had been encouraged by a surge in early voting among Latinos in the key battlegrounds of Nevada and Florida.\n\nDuring an afternoon rally in Cleveland, Clinton made no mention of Comey\u2019s decision, perhaps calculating that once again reminding voters of the original email investigation would do more harm than good.\n\nInstead, she focused, as she has at other recent rallies, on an optimistic look ahead.\n\n\u201cI want an America where every\u00adone has a place, where everyone is included,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd I know there is a lot of frustration, even anger, in this election season. I see it, I hear it, you know, I\u2019m a subject of it. I get it. But anger is not a plan. Anger is not going to get us new jobs.\u201d\n\nSunday\u2019s event was Clinton\u2019s last scheduled visit to Ohio, where she has trailed Trump in most recent polls despite a heavy emphasis on turning out black voters in Cleveland. This rally included Cleveland Cavaliers super\u00adstar LeBron James, an Ohio native. On Friday, husband and wife singers Jay Z and Beyonc\u00e9 had performed at another Clinton rally in Cleveland.\n\nIn his first rally after the news broke, Trump called Clinton the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency, and he predicted that her term in office would be shadowed by investigations. Later Sunday, in Sterling Heights, Mich., he said: \u201cHillary Clinton is guilty. She\u2019s knows it. The FBI knows it. . . . Now it\u2019s up to the American people to deliver justice at the ballot box on Nov. 8.\u201d\n\nTrump has been praised in recent days for avoiding the kind of insults and outbursts that had alienated voters in the past. A New York Times article on Sunday said that campaign aides have wrested away control of Trump\u2019s Twitter account, which the candidate had used to shoot himself in the metaphorical foot.\n\nBut on Sunday \u2014 while Clinton sought to lay out an optimistic, national message \u2014 Trump was in Minnesota, warning about a local immigrant population: Somalis, largely Muslim, who have left their war-ravaged country and settled in large numbers around Minneapolis.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even have the right to talk about it. You don\u2019t even know who\u2019s coming in. You have no idea. You\u2019ll find out. You\u2019ll find out,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHe mentioned a recent case in which 10 people were stabbed at a Minnesota mall. The attacker was a Somali man who had immigrated to the United States with his parents when he was 2. A news agency tied to the Islamic State later claimed responsibility for the attack, saying the man was a \u201csoldier\u201d for the group.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve suffered enough in Minnesota,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHe said Clinton would allow more refugees to enter: \u201cHer plan will import generations of terrorism.\u201d\n\nIn the last few days of the campaign, Trump has decided to invest time and resources in blue-leaning Midwestern states, including Minnesota, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Most recent opinion polls show Clinton leading in all three, but Trump is hoping for a surge among white voters who lack college degrees.\n\nAt each stop on Sunday, Trump was greeted by thousands of adoring fans. His aides saw these crowds as reason to hope for victories on Tuesday.\n\nOn Monday, the day before Election Day, Trump\u2019s schedule reflects his tough position \u2014 needing to win a string of states where the race is either tied or he is behind.\n\nHe will hold five rallies in a day, jetting from Florida to North Carolina to Pennsylvania to New Hampshire and then to Michigan.\n\nClinton, by contrast, will appear in three states: North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Michigan.\n\nOn Sunday, a spokesman for the FBI declined to comment on Comey\u2019s letter. A Justice Department spokesman said only that the department and the FBI had \u201cdedicated all necessary resources to conduct this review expeditiously.\u201d\n\nThe newly discovered emails came from a laptop owned by Weiner. Abedin has told people close to her that she does not know how her emails ended up on her husband\u2019s laptop.\n\nComey had come under fire for inserting the FBI into the campaign\u2019s final days after senior Justice Department officials warned him not to. Justice Department policy discourages the bureau from taking steps in the days before an election in an attempt to avoid the perception that the FBI is trying to the influence the outcome.\n\nOn Sunday, Comey\u2019s three-paragraph letter was sent to the chairmen of the Homeland Security, Judiciary, Appropriations and Oversight and Government Reform committees and was copied to the ranking Democratic members. Comey said the FBI had performed an \u201cextraordinary amount of high-quality work in a short period of time.\u201d\n\nAsked Sunday to react to Comey\u2019s announcement, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told MSNBC that \u201che\u2019s mishandled the investigation from the beginning.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said that regardless of Comey\u2019s announcement, \u201cthe undisputed finding of the FBI\u2019s investigation is that Secretary Clinton put our nation\u2019s secrets at risk and in doing so compromised our national security.\u201d\n\n\u201cFortunately, the American people have the opportunity to ensure Secretary Clinton never gets her hands on classified information again. Let\u2019s bring the Clinton era to an end by voting for Donald Trump on Tuesday,\u201d Ryan said in a statement.\n\nSen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said in a statement that the \u201cvague\u201d announcement by the FBI failed to provide context, and he was unsure even if the review was over.\n\n\u201cThe growing number of unanswered questions demand explanations,\u201d Grassley said. Is the FBI continuing to review the newly-revealed emails? Did the FBI limit its review to email from when Clinton was Secretary of State, leaving out emails that could shed light on possible obstruction of Congress?\u201d\n\nRep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said the announcement \u201caffirms and vindicates\u201d the FBI\u2019s July decision.\n\n\u201cOver the past week, Republicans have engaged in wild speculation and launched unsubstantiated accusations, but the FBI has determined \u2014 yet again \u2014 that they are without merit,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it is time for the American people to go forward based on the facts.\u201d\n\nJohnson reported from Minneapolis.

The investigators found that the emails were either duplicates of correspondence they had reviewed earlier or were personal emails that did not pertain to State Department business, government officials said.\n\nThe emails were on a computer used by former congressman Anthony Weiner - the estranged husband of longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin - that was seized during an FBI investigation into lewd text messages that Weiner, D-N.Y., is alleged to have sent to a 15-year-old girl.\n\nIn late October, Comey said that some of the emails on the computer, sent or received by Abedin, may have been \"pertinent\" to an FBI investigation of a private server that Clinton used to conduct government business.\n\nOn Sunday, however, Comey said that after reviewing emails on the computer, \"we have not changed our conclusions expressed in July.\"\n\nA Clinton spokeswoman on Sunday made a brief statement to reporters on the Democratic nominee's plane: \"We are glad to see that ... he has confirmed the conclusions that he reached in July,\" Jennifer Palmieri said of Comey. \"We are glad that this matter is resolved.\"\n\nThis past summer, Comey had ended an FBI probe into the server by saying that although he believed Clinton was \"extremely careless\" with classified information in the emails, Comey felt that \"no reasonable prosecutor\" would recommend criminal charges.\n\nOne of the government officials said Comey's letter on Sunday was not an \"interim report\" but rather represented a conclusion of the investigation.\n\nSo, after nine days of uncertainty, the FBI's investigators had ended where they began.\n\nIn the meantime, however, much had changed.\n\nComey - a nine-day hero to some on the right - was now under criticism from both sides, for jumping into the late stages of a presidential race and then trying to jump back out.\n\nThe FBI itself had been drawn into partisan politics, as leaks revealed internal fights between agents and prosecutors fighting over proposed investigations of the Clinton family.\n\nThe presidential race had also been altered.\n\nRepublican Donald Trump, who had been trailing badly in the polls when the new emails were revealed, had narrowed the gap in that time, leaning on a message that Clinton was \"crooked\" and likely to be charged.\n\nClinton, who had been trying to expand the electoral map by focusing on red states including Georgia and Arizona, drew back to defend blue turf like Michigan and Pennsylvania.

Or did he intend, after shaking up the election with his letter, to remain silent about the facts until the presidential votes had been tallied?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe F.B.I. offered no comment, and Justice Department officials said they had no idea what Mr. Comey saw as his next move. Justice Department officials were particularly puzzled about why Mr. Comey had alerted Congress \u2014 and by extension, the public \u2014 before agents even began reading the newly discovered emails to determine whether they contained classified information or added new facts to the case.\n\nLaw enforcement officials have begun the process to get court authority to read the emails, officials said. How soon they will get that is unclear, but there is no chance that the review will be completed before Election Day, several law enforcement officials said. Many of the emails are most likely copies of messages that the F.B.I. has already read, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.\n\nDespite the Justice Department\u2019s concerns, Mr. Comey felt obligated to send the letter. But it opened him up to fierce criticism not only from Democrats but also from current and former officials at the F.B.I. and the Justice Department, including Republicans.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a longstanding policy of not doing anything that could influence an election,\u201d said George J. Terwilliger III, a deputy attorney general under President George Bush. \u201cThose guidelines exist for a reason. Sometimes, that makes for hard decisions. But bypassing them has consequences.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between being independent and flying solo.\u201d\n\nAfter reports surfaced late last month that Mr. Weiner had sent illicit text messages to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, top prosecutors in Charlotte and Manhattan jockeyed for the case. Senior officials in the Justice Department decided that if there were a prosecution, it would take place in New York under the supervision of the United States attorney there, Preet Bharara.\n\nAlmost immediately, it became clear to investigators that the Weiner case might reignite the Clinton inquiry. Mr. Weiner\u2019s estranged wife, Huma Abedin, is a top adviser to Mrs. Clinton, and F.B.I. agents in the earlier investigation had interviewed her and reviewed her emails looking for classified information.\n\nOn Oct. 3, F.B.I. agents seized several electronic devices from Mr. Weiner: a laptop, his iPhone and an iPad that was in large measure used by his 4-year-old son to watch cartoons, a person with knowledge of the matter said. Days later, F.B.I. agents also confiscated a Wi-Fi router that could identify any other devices that had been used, the person said.\n\nWhile searching the laptop, the agents discovered the existence of tens of thousands of emails, some of them sent between Ms. Abedin and other Clinton aides, according to senior law enforcement officials. It is not clear if Ms. Abedin downloaded the emails to the laptop or if they were automatically backed up there. The emails dated back years, the officials said. Ms. Abedin has testified that she did not routinely delete her emails.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBecause of the age of the emails, many could be outside the scope of the Clinton inquiry, investigators said. And while many are probably duplicative, some would be worth reading, the F.B.I. concluded.\n\nIn conversations this month, senior Justice Department and F.B.I. officials agreed that the matter was worth pursuing. By law, though, agents and prosecutors in the Clinton investigation could not immediately read the new emails without court authority.\n\nThe authorities decided only recently to seek that approval. They do not know whether the emails contain classified information or, if they do, whether that would change their determination that nobody should be charged with mishandling it.\n\nSo Justice Department officials were surprised on Thursday afternoon to receive notice of Mr. Comey\u2019s intention to send the letter to Congress. The letter, issued as early voting was underway in some states, guaranteed a new round of questions for Mrs. Clinton just before Election Day.\n\nThe Justice Department and the F.B.I. have a longstanding policy against discussing current criminal investigations. Another Justice Department policy, restated each election cycle, declares that politics should play no role in investigative decisions. Both Democratic and Republican administrations have interpreted that policy broadly to cover any steps that might give even an impression of partisanship.\n\n\u201cWe must be particularly sensitive to safeguarding the department\u2019s reputation for fairness, neutrality and nonpartisanship,\u201d said a 2012 memo from the attorney general\u2019s office that restated the policy.\n\nGet the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Lynch did not directly speak with Mr. Comey about the matter, officials said, but senior Justice Department officials sent word of her concerns. Though Ms. Lynch is technically Mr. Comey\u2019s boss, she, too, faced a dilemma. If she ordered Mr. Comey not to send the letter, it could appear that she was trying to withhold information from Congress.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter hearing the Justice Department\u2019s argument, Mr. Comey concluded that the ramifications of not telling Congress far outweighed concerns about the department guidelines, one senior law enforcement official said.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Comey sent Congress the letter, which said emails had surfaced in a case unrelated to the Clinton case. Mr. Comey said that the F.B.I. would review the emails to determine if they improperly contained classified information, adding that the emails \u201cappear to be pertinent.\u201d\n\nIt was the latest example of a sometimes strained relationship between the Justice Department and Mr. Comey, who \u2014 on issues of race, encryption, policing and, most notably, the Clinton investigation \u2014 has branded himself as someone who operates outside Washington\u2019s typical chain of command.\n\nThe letter rankled Mrs. Clinton\u2019s supporters in part because Mr. Comey has been circumspect in his remarks about another federal investigation, this one involving allegations of Russian meddling in the election. American officials believe that Russian intelligence agents are behind the hacking of Democratic National Committee emails, which have embarrassed the Clinton campaign.\n\nSenior Democrats have called on the F.B.I. to investigate whether any of Donald J. Trump\u2019s aides are colluding with Russia. Some of his aides have ties to Russian interests, but they have denied any wrongdoing.\n\nWhile Mr. Comey told Congress last month that he would not confirm the existence of any investigation into people associated with Mr. Trump, he said he felt compelled to discuss details of the Clinton investigation because it involved \u201cexceptional circumstances where the public needed information.\u201d\n\nMatthew Miller, a Democrat and former Justice Department spokesman who has criticized Mr. Comey\u2019s handling of the email investigation, said the F.B.I. director should not pick and choose when to follow the guidelines.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t apply the usual standard to one candidate and an entirely different set of rules for the other,\u201d he said."}, {"image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/10/31/us/31QandA-web/31QandA-web-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "summary": "The emails will be reviewed by the same counterintelligence team in Washington that handled the Clinton investigation from the beginning.\nAgents will have probable cause to search only the messages related to the Clinton investigation.\nMr. Comey has faced widespread criticism since his announcement on Friday, and senior Justice Department and F.B.I.\nOnce it became clear that the emails were potentially significant, lawyers at the Justice Department and the F.B.I.\nThe Clinton campaign kept up the pressure on Mr. Comey on Sunday by releasing a letter signed by nearly 100 former senior Justice Department officials who sharply criticized the F.B.I.", "title": "Justice Department Obtains Warrant to Review Clinton Aide\u2019s Emails", "created_at": 1477886400.0, "keywords": ["clinton", "department", "fbi", "aides", "comey", "mr", "justice", "warrant", "officials", "ms", "letter", "review", "investigation", "emails", "obtains"], "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/31/us/politics/justice-department-warrant-clinton-abedin-fbi.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss", "text": "A federal law enforcement official said agents had discovered hundreds of thousands of emails on Mr. Weiner\u2019s computer, but investigators expected to examine only part of the total.

Both Mrs. Clinton and her Republican rival, Donald J.

Ms. Abedin has said she did not routinely delete emails, and people close to her said she did not know these emails were on Mr. Weiner\u2019s computers. It is not clear how they got there, but it is possible they were automatically backed up.\n\nThe Justice Department efforts were described by three federal law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe F.B.I. knew weeks ago that its investigation into whether Mr. Weiner sent illicit text messages to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina had the potential to reignite the Clinton case. After agents seized Mr. Weiner\u2019s laptop, phone and tablet on Oct. 3, they quickly learned the computer contained a trove of Ms. Abedin\u2019s emails.\n\nThe assistant F.B.I. director in charge of the New York field office then notified the deputy director in Washington about the discovery, according to one senior law enforcement official. Agents in the Weiner case were not allowed to widely search Ms. Abedin\u2019s emails, but were told to conduct a cursory review of the metadata \u2014 the \u201cto\u201d and \u201cfrom\u201d information on each message \u2014 to see if any of the emails could be relevant to the Clinton investigation.\n\nOnce it became clear that the emails were potentially significant, lawyers at the Justice Department and the F.B.I. conducted a legal analysis of how to proceed, officials said. Because Ms. Abedin\u2019s emails were not directly related to the investigation of her husband, criminal agents could neither read the contents of the emails nor pass them to their colleagues in Washington.\n\nLate last week, the authorities decided to seek a search warrant to examine the emails. Mr. Comey\u2019s letter gave that effort a tremendous sense of urgency. Suddenly, a follow-up inquiry that was expected to take weeks or months now needed to be rushed before Election Day.\n\nMr. Comey\u2019s letter also opened him up to criticism from Democrats that he seemed willing to disclose every investigative wrinkle related to the Clinton investigation, but has not said anything about the scope of an F.B.I. investigation into Russian meddling in American elections.

Trump, characterized the move that way. Agents could open a new inquiry if they find evidence that the earlier investigation had been impeded or that classified materials had been intentionally mishandled.\n\nWhere did these new emails come from?\n\nMr. Comey did not say in his letter. But law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation said that agents had discovered the emails on a laptop owned by Anthony D. Weiner, the disgraced former congressman and estranged husband of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s top aide, Huma Abedin.\n\nLast month, the F.B.I. began investigating allegations that Mr. Weiner had exchanged sexually explicit messages with a teenager. On Oct. 3, agents in New York executed a search warrant to obtain Mr. Weiner\u2019s iPhone, an iPad and the laptop. Searching the laptop, they found evidence of a trove of emails similar to ones that had been examined in the Clinton investigation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Comey decided last week that agents should examine those emails to determine whether they contained national security information. That requires a court order, and officials said agents had not yet begun reading the emails.\n\nWhy does the F.B.I. care if there is classified information in the emails?\n\nUnder federal law, mishandling national security information is a crime, one that the F.B.I. is responsible for investigating. In 2015, the bureau began investigating the personal email account that Mrs. Clinton had used exclusively as secretary of state. As part of that investigation, the bureau tried to find every electronic device \u2014 phones, tablets, computers \u2014 that Mrs. Clinton and her aides used.\n\nAgents could not find many of them, including several of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s cellphones and two iPads. The agents knew that those devices, and others they were not aware of, might someday surface. But they completed the Clinton case because they found no evidence that anyone had intentionally broken the law.\n\nThe newly discovered emails may \u2014 or may not \u2014 provide new information to the F.B.I.\n\nWhy did Mr. Comey send the letter?\n\nIn July, Mr. Comey told Congress that the Clinton investigation was complete but that if new information came to light, the bureau would examine it. Mr. Comey pledged to be as transparent as he could with Congress about the investigation, and has since made public hundreds of pages of documents related to the inquiry.\n\nAccording to senior F.B.I. officials, Mr. Comey felt that he would be breaking his pledge of transparency to Congress if he did not reveal the new information from the Weiner case. And he believed that the bureau would be accused of suppressing details to benefit Mrs. Clinton \u2014 an accusation that he believed could do lasting damage to the F.B.I.\u2019s credibility.\n\nWho is upset with Mr. Comey for sending the letter?\n\nMany Democrats and even some Republicans have called the letter vague, troubling and unprecedented. Senior officials at the Justice Department urged Mr. Comey not to send the letter, saying it violated the spirit of longstanding policies not to discuss current investigations or do anything that could be seen as meddling in an election.\n\nIn the letter, Mr. Comey said that the F.B.I. had yet to determine whether \u201cthis material may be significant,\u201d and that he could not predict how long the review would take. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign has pushed Mr. Comey to release more information about the emails.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHer campaign chairman, John D. Podesta, said that \u201cby providing selective information, he has allowed partisans to distort and exaggerate to inflict maximum political damage.\u201d\n\nWhat does all of this mean for Mrs. Clinton and her campaign?\n\nThe short answer is that it is not yet clear. Polling on weekends can be unreliable, so it may be a few days before the effect of the development can be fully assessed. What is evident is that a campaign that has largely been a referendum on Mr. Trump \u2014 particularly since the first debate \u2014 is now not so clear-cut. The email development will certainly matter, but the question is just how much.\n\nTwenty million people have already voted, and millions more have already determined whom they will support. The country was already politically polarized before this election, and opinions are overwhelmingly cemented about these two household-name nominees.\n\nThe email news could matter most in down-ballot races. After being on the defensive for weeks because of Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior, Republican candidates now have a more helpful news media environment in which to make their closing arguments. And Republican voters who are otherwise demoralized may have been given one final nudge to show up to the polls.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nIn the coming days, the F.B.I. will begin conducting a smaller version of the larger investigation it completed in July. Agents will go through the emails found on the laptop to determine whether they contain classified information.\n\nIf so, the bureau will again look at the question of whether anyone intentionally committed a crime. Clinton campaign officials have said that Ms. Abedin gave the authorities all of the electronic devices that she believed had work-related emails on them. Many of the newly discovered messages are likely to be duplicates of others that the F.B.I. has already examined, investigators say. The review will be conducted by the same Washington-based F.B.I. agents who led the investigation into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails. F.B.I. agents are all but certain that it will not be completed by Election Day, and believe it will take at least several weeks.\n\nNeither Justice Department officials nor F.B.I. agents say they know what to expect from Mr. Comey over the coming days. Normally, investigations are conducted secretly, but Mr. Comey\u2019s public remarks have opened him up to demands from both campaigns that he make as much information public as possible as soon as it is available.\n\nGet the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

If the new emails indicate intentional efforts by her or her aides to move such information outside secure government systems, or if they tried to impede the earlier inquiry, the F.B.I. will most likely want to investigate further. But the bureau has just begun the process of combing through the new emails, and officials believe that at least some are duplicates of messages that have already been examined.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHow rare is it for the F.B.I. to make a development like this public?\n\nExtremely rare. At times during trials or after cases are closed, the F.B.I. finds new evidence and either discloses it to defense lawyers or reopens a case. An F.B.I. director has never made such a disclosure to Congress so close to a presidential election.\n\nHow did Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the Justice Department feel about Mr. Comey\u2019s letter?\n\nSenior Justice Department officials tried to discourage Mr. Comey from sending the letter, saying that it would violate department guidelines that advise against talking about current criminal investigations or being seen as meddling in elections.\n\nThey urged Mr. Comey not to do anything before Election Day, and they said he should tell Congress when agents had read the emails, understood whether they were relevant and could put them in context.

Comey, told Congress on Sunday that he had seen no evidence in a recently discovered trove of emails to change his conclusion that Hillary Clinton should face no charges over her handling of classified information.\n\nMr. Comey\u2019s announcement, just two days before the election, was an effort to clear the cloud of suspicion he had publicly placed over her presidential campaign late last month when he alerted Congress that the F.B.I. would examine the emails.\n\n\u201cBased on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton,\u201d Mr. Comey wrote in a letter to the leaders of several congressional committees. He said agents had reviewed all communications to and from Mrs. Clinton in the new trove from when she was secretary of state.\n\nThe letter was a dramatic final twist in a tumultuous nine days for both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Comey, who drew widespread criticism for announcing that the F.B.I. had discovered new emails that might be relevant to its investigation of Mrs. Clinton, which ended in July with no charges. That criticism of Mr. Comey from both parties is likely to persist after the election.\n\nWhile the new letter was clear as it related to Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Comey\u2019s message was otherwise vague. He did not say that agents had completed their review of the emails, or that they were abandoning the matter in regard to her aides. But federal law enforcement officials said that they considered the review of emails related to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s server complete, and that Mr. Comey\u2019s letter was intended to convey that.\n\nOne senior law enforcement official said that as recently as Friday, it was not clear whether the review would be completed by Election Day. But after days of working in shifts around the clock, teams of counterintelligence agents and technology specialists at the bureau\u2019s headquarters in Washington finished their examination of the thousands of emails. Officials had decided to make their decision public as soon as they had reached it, to avoid any suggestion that they were suppressing information.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAccording to the law enforcement official, many of the emails were personal messages or duplicates of ones that the bureau had previously examined during the original inquiry.\n\nBrian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, said in a post on Twitter that the campaign had always believed she would be cleared of any wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cWe were always confident nothing would cause the July decision to be revisited,\u201d Mr. Fallon said. \u201cNow Director Comey has confirmed it.\u201d\n\nKellyanne Conway, Donald J. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, lamented the fact that Mr. Comey had again inserted himself into the election, but she predicted that his conclusion would have no effect on the outcome.\n\n\u201cThe investigation has been mishandled from the beginning,\u201d Ms. Conway said on MSNBC, arguing that Mrs. Clinton had wasted taxpayer money and federal resources because of her email practices. \u201cShe was reckless, she was careless, she was selfish.\u201d\n\nThe new review began after agents discovered a cache of emails in early October in an unrelated investigation into the disgraced former congressman Anthony D. Weiner, the estranged husband of one of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s closest aides. When searching Mr. Weiner\u2019s laptop for evidence of whether he had exchanged illicit messages with a teenage girl, they discovered emails belonging to the aide, Huma Abedin.\n\nThat announcement renewed talk of an investigation that had shadowed Mrs. Clinton for much of the Democratic primary campaign. She and her aides had been under investigation for improperly storing classified information on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s private email server. The discovery of new emails raised the prospect that the laptop might have new information that would renew the F.B.I. inquiry.\n\nFederal law enforcement officials had said for the past week that only something astounding would change their conclusion that nobody should be charged. But the mere potential for legal trouble was enough to make Republicans gleeful, and Mr. Trump highlighted the F.B.I.\u2019s actions in campaign ads.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the end of a rocky week for Mrs. Clinton that included wild, false speculation about looming indictments and shocking discoveries in the emails, Mr. Comey\u2019s letter swept away her largest and most immediate problem.\n\nRepublicans immediately accused Mr. Comey of making his announcement prematurely. \u201cComey must be under enormous political pressure to cave like this and announce something he can\u2019t possibly know,\u201d Newt Gingrich, a Trump adviser, wrote on Twitter.\n\nMr. Comey\u2019s move is also sure to prompt questions from Democrats. Most important among them: Why did Mr. Comey raise the specter of wrongdoing before agents had even read the emails, especially since it took only days to determine that they were not significant?\n\nJust hours before Mr. Comey sent the letter to Capitol Hill, Senate Democrats said hearings should be held to examine how Mr. Comey had handled the matter. After the letter\u2019s release, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said the Justice Department \u201cneeds to take a look at its procedures to prevent similar actions that could influence future elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that it created a false impression about the nature of the agency\u2019s inquiry,\u201d she added.\n\nThe F.B.I. director\u2019s vague, brief announcement on Oct. 28 left Mrs. Clinton with few details to rebut and little time to do it. Many current and former F.B.I. agents and Justice Department officials said Mr. Comey had needlessly plunged the F.B.I. into the politics of a presidential election, with no clear way out.\n\nA long list of former Justice Department officials, including Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., chided Mr. Comey. Despite the fact that the bureau did not find anything that changed its original conclusion about Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Comey has insisted that he had no choice but to inform Congress about the new emails because the investigation had been completed and he had pledged transparency, according to senior F.B.I. officials.\n\nBecause of Mr. Comey\u2019s Oct. 28 letter, Attorney General Loretta Lynch made completing a review of the emails a top priority. Late last month, Mr. Comey ordered agents to work around the clock to sift through the messages. That process, senior F.B.I. officials said, was painstaking, because each message that had been sent to Mrs. Clinton had to be reviewed to determine whether it had sensitive national security materials.\n\nIn Mr. Comey\u2019s short letter to Congress on Sunday, he said he was \u201cvery grateful to the professionals at the F.B.I. for doing an extraordinary amount of high-quality work in a short period of time.\u201d"}]}, {"story_id": 1, "articles": [{"image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-581917bb/turbine/la-na-clinton-emails-calculus-20161101", "summary": "Even if FBI agents discover classified information on a newly seized laptop, Hillary Clinton is unlikely to face criminal charges, according to legal experts and former federal prosecutors.\nThat\u2019s even assuming the emails they find on the laptop are classified emails.\nIn the end, agents uncovered classified information in 193 emails that were part of 81 email chains, though none of the emails were marked with a classified header.\nThere may all be duplicates, or emails that don\u2019t have any classified information.\nWe don\u2019t know.\u201dAnd even if agents discover evidence that warrants an indictment, Comey\u2019s past public statements could undermine a future prosecution, legal experts said.", "title": "It would take a bombshell for FBI to charge Clinton in email case, experts say", "created_at": 1477972800.0, "keywords": ["say", "fbi", "experts", "bombshell", "charge", "clinton", "federal", "case", "email", "evidence", "classified", "emails", "laptop", "agents", "information"], "url": "http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-clinton-emails-calculus-20161101-story.html#nt=barker&bn=Barker%2006%20-%20In%20Case%20You%20Missed%20It", "text": "Even if FBI agents discover classified information on a newly seized laptop, Hillary Clinton is unlikely to face criminal charges, according to legal experts and former federal prosecutors.\n\nThat\u2019s largely because the Justice Department and FBI Director James B.

We don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nAnd even if agents discover evidence that warrants an indictment, Comey\u2019s past public statements could undermine a future prosecution, legal experts said.\n\nDefense lawyers would certainly seek all records associated with his public announcement in July, when he declared Clinton\u2019s actions were \u201ccareless\u201d but not criminal.\n\nAn about-face by the FBI would permit defense attorneys to attack the thoroughness of the entire investigation, pointing out that it failed to turn up Abedin\u2019s emails on a laptop she shared with her husband.\n\n\u201cA classic defense in any criminal case is to accuse the investigating law enforcement agents of \u2018shoddy police work.\u2019\u201d said Mary Pat Brown, a former federal prosecutor. \u201cWhen there are inconsistencies in the evidence itself, or any delays or missteps in collecting evidence, the government\u2019s case is vulnerable to attack.\u201d\n\nComey\u2019s unusual move to publicly discuss the case with reporters and Congress in July was in part to demonstrate that the bureau\u2019s inquiry was meticulous and independent.\n\nBut Vladeck agreed his action could now backfire. \u201cThose statements make it difficult for there ever to be a prosecution,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cComey laid a trap for himself in July.\u201d\n\nPerceptions that the new emails won\u2019t dramatically change the case are part of the reason Clinton supporters were so incensed by Comey\u2019s surprise and vague announcement last week that the bureau would examine the materials over the coming weeks.\n\nAgents are hoping to have a preliminary assessment of the Abedin emails completed by election day, though it remains unclear whether the FBI will make a further public statement about the case, despite calls for more information from both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nAgents will need to sort out Abedin\u2019s emails, discard duplicates and then examine what\u2019s left to see if anything is relevant to the Clinton inquiry, a federal law enforcement official said.\n\nThe laptop contains hundreds of thousands of emails \u2014 most of them Weiner\u2019s \u2014 and it will take weeks to fully vet them, the official said.\n\n@delwilber\n\ndel.wilber@latimes.com"}]}, {"story_id": 1, "articles": [{"image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/11/02/National-Politics/Images/AFP_HN9NB.jpg", "summary": "As for the release of the Rich files days before the election, FBI officials said the timing was coincidental.\nFBI officials did not respond to questions about the agency\u2019s role in the campaign.\nLater, as U.S. attorney, he led the office that handled the investigation into the Clinton pardon from early 2002 to the end of 2003.\nThe Post\u2019s Matt Zapotosky explains why FBI Director James B.

But the official said the FBI was deploying \u201call computers, all hands on deck\u201d to sort through the high volume of emails and that \u201cno one knows\u201d what the emails contain.\n\nFBI officials did not respond to questions about the agency\u2019s role in the campaign.\n\nAs for the release of the Rich files days before the election, FBI officials said the timing was coincidental. The FBI released a statement saying that they were published after Freedom of Information Act requests and were posted \u201cautomatically and electronically to the FBI\u2019s public reading room in accordance with the law and established procedures.\u201d This happens, the statement said, on a \u201cfirst-in, first-out\u201d basis.\n\nAt a rally in at Kent State University, Oct. 31, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton spoke about the FBI investigation into emails that might be connected to her private email server. She said \"by all means, they should look at\" emails on a computer owned by Anthony Weiner, the husband of her top aide, Huma Abedin. (The Washington Post)\n\nThe events of the past week have created an unusual political storm around Comey, who until this election year had generally drawn praise from leaders of both parties. When he announced in July that he believed that \u201cno reasonable prosecutor\u201d would charge Clinton for mishandling classified information through her use of a private email server, Democrats called him fair-minded while some Republicans, including Trump, accused him of being part of a rigged system. This week, the roles have been reversed.\n\nRep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), who led the House investigation of the attacks on the U.S. diplomatic posts in Benghazi, Libya, said Tuesday that Democrats are improperly blaming Comey for a sequence of events that began with Clinton\u2019s decision as secretary of state to use a private server. \u201cSecretary Clinton is the reason why you and I are having this conversation, not Jim Comey,\u201d he told CNN.\n\nThe Twitter account used to publicize the Rich files, an official FBI account called\u00ad@FBIRecordsVault, had been dormant for more than a year until Sunday, when it began to tweet links to archived documents. They included records related to Fred Trump, the father of the GOP nominee, which were posted to the website in early October. Those records included eight\u00ad \u00adpages of largely biographical details about the elder Trump, much of which appeared to be compiled by the FBI in 1988. The agency advertised the Trump records by tweeting: \u201cFred C. Trump (1905-1999) was a real estate developer and philanthropist.\u201d\n\nAnother tweet linked to previously released internal investigative notes from the FBI\u2019s probe of Clinton\u2019s private email server.\n\nAgency officials said the tweets were automatically generated, a function of the website they said had not been working since last year but was recently fixed when the site was upgraded.\n\nThe Rich documents provided little new information about the matter, which plagued the first years of Bill Clinton\u2019s post-presidency. But they served as a reminder of the vigor of the criminal probe into the matter.\n\nRich, who received his pardon on Bill Clinton\u2019s last day in the White House, had fled to Switzerland after learning he would be indicted on a charge of tax evasion in the 1980s. The investigation, conducted between 2001 and 2005, was disclosed in news accounts at the time and looked at whether Clinton had issued the pardon in exchange for political donations, including to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2000 Senate race and to the Clinton Foundation. It was closed with no charges.\n\nThe newly disclosed documents show the FBI internally referred to the matter as a \u201csensitive investigation concerning possible public corruption surrounding the pardons granted by former president William Clinton.\u201d\n\nThis week\u2019s release of the Rich files demonstrates how many of the players in the current Hillary Clinton drama played roles in Clinton-related battles of the past.\n\nComey, for instance, as a young prosecutor in New York, helped lead the case against Rich. Later, as U.S. attorney, he led the office that handled the investigation into the Clinton pardon from early 2002 to the end of 2003.\n\nFormer attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr., a Clinton backer who this week wrote in a Washington Post op-ed that Comey made a \u201cserious error\u201d in sending the letter to Congress, was deputy attorney general at the time of the pardon and acknowledged that he had been contacted directly by Rich\u2019s attorney. The pardon was criticized in part for bypassing an established process in which Justice lawyers review applications for merit. Holder\u2019s name was one of only a few not blacked out in the redacted files released this week.\n\nComey eventually supported Holder\u2019s nomination for attorney general but told senators in 2008 that he had been \u201cstunned\u201d by the Rich pardon and that Holder\u2019s actions in the case reflected a \u201chuge misjudgment.\u201d\n\nThe release of the Rich files came as Democrats had been expressing their anger over Comey\u2019s handling of their suspicions of Russian meddling. For months, Democrats have been talking about alleged ties that Trump and his team have to Russia, and they have been encouraging the FBI to investigate the claims \u2014 in addition to the ongoing inquiry into how Russian hackers broke in to the Democratic National Committee and the private email accounts of top party officials.\n\nOn Sunday, Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) said Comey possessed \u201cexplosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government.\u201d In a letter to Comey, Reid suggested that the FBI director may have violated a federal statute, the Hatch Act, that prohibits government officials from engaging in activities that can influence an election.\n\n\u201cThrough your partisan actions, you may have broken the law,\u201d Reid wrote.\n\nWhen asked about Reid\u2019s letter, a White House spokesman bluntly declined to back up his claims and concerns.\n\nPress secretary Josh Earnest told reporters that the Obama administration would \u201cneither defend nor criticize\u201d Comey, and that the White House had received no FBI briefings \u201con even the existence of any investigation into the activities or habits of the Republican nominee.\u201d\n\nReid was briefed privately in August about the Russia threat by one of the country\u2019s top intelligence officials and came away \u201cdeeply shaken,\u201d according to an aide who was traveling with him at the time. During the private session, conducted in a specially secured briefing room at the FBI\u2019s Las Vegas office, Reid told aides he received disturbing details of Russian efforts to influence the election \u2014 and about possible Trump campaign ties to the Kremlin.\n\nAfterward, he wrote Comey urging the FBI director to publicly investigate \u201ca series of disturbing reports\u201d indicating that Russia was trying \u201cto influence the Trump campaign and manipulate it as a vehicle for advancing the interests of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\u201d\n\nTrump, who has called Putin a \u201cstrong leader,\u201d has denied any connections to Russia.\n\nBut the FBI\u2019s approach to the questions has frustrated Democrats. Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said Comey\u2019s decision to speak out on the Clinton emails while choosing to remain silent on Russia \u201craises serious questions about a very disturbing double standard.\u201d\n\nClinton campaign manager, Robby Mook, said it was \u201cnothing short of jaw-dropping\u201d that Comey would \u201cshow more discretion in a matter concerning a foreign-state actor than one involving the Democratic nominee for president.\u201d\n\nMatt Zapotosky, Karoun Demirjian, Alice Crites, Ellen Nakashima and Bob Woodward contributed to this report."}, {"image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58192e28/turbine/ct-fbi-archive-bill-clinton-20161101", "summary": "As for the release of the Rich files days before the election, FBI officials said the timing was coincidental.\nThe agency advertised the Trump records by tweeting: \"Fred C.

That crime, the county\u2019s first quadruple homicide, had remained unsolved since 2003.\n\nKohlhepp also showed authorities Saturday where he says he buried two other, unidentified victims on his 95-acre property, the AP reported.\n\nOfficials now believe Kohlhepp is responsible for at least seven deaths, in addition to kidnapping Brown.\n\nKohlhepp was charged Friday with one count of kidnapping, according to court records. Prosecutor Barry Barnette said in court Friday that Brown saw Kohlhepp fatally shoot her boyfriend and that additional charges were expected, the AP reported.\n\n[Body is found on S.C. property where missing woman was chained \u2018like a dog\u2019 in metal container]\n\nThe gruesome revelations are a stark contrast to Kohlhepp\u2019s professional image. On the surface, Kohlhepp was a polished Realtor who ran a successful South Carolina real estate firm upstate. In a company brochure, Kohlhepp portrayed himself as a tech-savvy professional committed to helping people buy and sell homes in Greenville and Spartanburg counties.\n\n\u201cAt Todd Kohlhepp & Associates we feel that it\u2019s important for our clients to know a little more about who\u2019s working for them besides a name and number,\u201d read the first part of his bio.\n\nBeneath it was a picture of Kohlhepp dressed in a pinstripe suit, smiling broadly, next to a list of his business qualifications. He boasted that he was a licensed pilot and that his company had \u201cOne Focus \u2026 Results!\u201d\n\nBut there was no mention of Kohlhepp\u2019s criminal history and why he was a registered sex offender.\n\nDetails from his childhood \u2014 particularly his conviction for the 1986 rape of a teenage girl in Tempe, Ariz. \u2014 hint at a deeply troubled individual who harbored violent tendencies from an early age, according to court records obtained by the Arizona Republic.\n\nRecords showed that when Kohlhepp was 15 he went to a neighbor\u2019s house, held a .22-caliber handgun to the 14-year-old girl\u2019s head and demanded that she follow him, the Republic reported. Once back at his home, Kohlhepp duct-taped the girl\u2019s mouth, restrained her hands and raped her \u2014 then told her he would kill her and her younger siblings if she called police, according to the paper.\n\nThe girl reported the rape to police, and Kohlhepp was arrested on kidnapping and sexual assault charges, court records showed. He took a plea bargain, pleading guilty to just the kidnapping charge, and was sentenced to 15 years in prison.\n\nAn extensive psychiatric evaluation of Kohlhepp, then 16, revealed a sometimes suicidal teenager who saw himself \u201cas a loner, hostile toward other children and not wanting to be around people,\u201d according to a report first obtained by Greenville Online.\n\nKohlhepp\u2019s parents had divorced when he was a baby, the report said, and he was raised mostly by his mother and stepfather. After they separated in 1982, Kohlhepp began acting out, destroying his room and breaking mirrors so that his mother would send him to live with his biological father.\n\nThe report also detailed other alleged violent acts from Kohlhepp\u2019s childhood. He destroyed his bedroom with a hammer, hit other classmates, was caught \u201cCloroxing\u201d a goldfish, shot a dog with a BB gun and was dismissed from the Boy Scouts because he was too disruptive, the report said.\n\nA teenage Kohlhepp described his father as \u201ca lier [sic] and preoccupied with guns\u201d who allegedly taught the boy how to \u201cblow things up and make bombs,\u201d according to the report. He had occasionally considered killing his father, whom he accused of physical abuse, but also \u201chad this rage turned back at himself,\u201d the report said.\n\nIn the 1987 report, Kohlhepp told the psychiatrist that when police were outside his home to arrest him after the rape of the 14-year-old girl, he put the gun to his head and pulled the trigger, but it jammed. \u201cAt this point, he laughed somewhat inappropriately,\u201d the report said. \u201cHe stated \u2018Someone doesn\u2019t want me to die yet.\u2019 \u201d\n\nKohlhepp seemed conflicted about the rape, alternately describing it as something he was ashamed of but also something that he had done to \u201cget back\u201d at his father. The report went on to say that Kohlhepp did not appear to suffer from hallucinations, delusions or other cognitive deficits; in fact, he seemed to be in the \u201cnormal intellectual range\u201d and \u201ctended to minimize his problem and expressed hope that he would go back to school and get a GED.\u201d\n\nThe psychiatrist said there was \u201cconvincing evidence\u201d that Kohlhepp had borderline personality disorder. \u201cThroughout the interview, one got the feeling that if he were pushed to any limits, he was potentially explosive,\u201d the psychiatrist wrote. The psychiatrist also warned that Kohlhepp\u2019s \u201csevere underlying emotional issues \u2026 could result in emotional deterioration in the future or continued aggressive behavior toward others in the future.\u201d\n\nKohlhepp was released from prison Nov. 24, 2001, according to the Arizona Department of Corrections. Records also showed that he received postsecondary education and vocational training while in prison.\n\nIn his company brochure, Todd Kohlhepp portrayed himself as a dedicated real estate professional. (Courtesy Todd Kohlhepp & Associates)\n\nAt some point, Kohlhepp moved to South Carolina and built a real estate business (his real estate license is listed as valid through June 2017, according to the state\u2019s Labor, Licensing and Regulation Department).\n\nWhen Kohlhepp applied for his South Carolina real estate license in 2006, he explained his sex offender status in a two-page letter filled with details that contradicted court documents regarding the 1986 charges, according to the Independent Mail:\n\nKohlhepp wrote, in his 2006 letter about the 1986 incident, that he had been in a heated argument with his girlfriend, they were both 15 at the time, they ended their relationship and afterward chased his dog and returned to his house. Police showed up at the home, after having been called by the girl\u2019s parents, who were concerned they could not reach her by phone, Kohlhepp wrote. He explained in the letter that the kidnapping charge stemmed from a firearm he was carrying and because \u201cI had told her not to move while we talked this out.\u201d Kohlhepp said he had been carrying a gun because he was concerned about crime in the Phoenix area and chalked it up to a youthful mistake.\n\nKohlhepp was granted a real estate license about three weeks after he applied, the Independent Mail reported. \u201cOur community has been deeply disturbed by this,\u201d Nick Kremydas, chief executive of South Carolina Realtors, told the paper. \u201cThe alleged acts of this person are not representative of us.\u201d\n\n[Missing man\u2019s Facebook account suddenly comes alive, terrifying family]\n\nState records showed that Todd Kohlhepp & Associates had two offices, one in Moore and another in Greenville, and that Kohlhepp supervised nearly a dozen agents.

He boasted that he was a licensed pilot and that his company had \"One Focus ... Results!\"\n\nBut all of that omitted disturbing details about the 45-year-old's past criminal history and why he was a registered sex offender.\n\nOver the last week, Spartanburg County sheriff's deputies have made shocking discoveries on a sprawling, wooded property Kohlhepp owned in Woodruff, a small city in rural South Carolina.\n\nOn Thursday, police found a 30-year-old woman who had been \"chained like a dog\" inside a metal storage container on Kohlhepp's land.\n\n\"It was pretty emotional, to say the least, when she was found - especially when she was chained like a dog,\" Spartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright told WYFF News. \"She had a chain around her neck.\"\n\nThe \"obviously traumatized\" woman had screamed for help when sheriff's deputies knocked on the side of the container, about 30 feet long, 15 feet wide and 10 to 12 feet high, Wright said. Though the woman's identity has been reported elsewhere, the Chicago Tribune typically does not identify victims of sexual assault.\n\nThe woman and her boyfriend, Charles \"David\" Carver, 32, had been missing since Aug. 31, triggering an agonizing search by their worried family members and friends. Cellphone and social media records led authorities to Kohlhepp's property in Woodruff.\n\nShe told deputies she had been kept and fed inside the metal container for two months and warned that there could be other victims, WYFF reported, and police continued to search the property.\n\nEarly Friday, investigators discovered a body buried in a shallow grave on Kohlhepp's land, which was identified Saturday as belonging to Carver, according to the Associated Press. The coroner said Carver died of multiple gunshot wounds but did not say how many times he had been shot, the AP reported.\n\nAnd later Saturday, Kohlhepp reportedly confessed to killing four people at a motorcycle shop nearly 13 years ago in Chesnee, South Carolina, according to the AP. That crime, the county's first quadruple homicide, had remained unsolved since 2003.\n\nTodd Kohlhepp Heidi Heilbrunn//The Greenville News Todd Kohlhepp, in handcuffs and an orange jumpsuit, is escorted by deputies on his property in Woodruff, S.C., on Saturday, Nov. 5, 2016. Todd Kohlhepp, in handcuffs and an orange jumpsuit, is escorted by deputies on his property in Woodruff, S.C., on Saturday, Nov. 5, 2016. (Heidi Heilbrunn//The Greenville News) (Heidi Heilbrunn//The Greenville News)\n\nKohlhepp also showed authorities Saturday where he says he buried two other, unidentified victims on his 95-acre property, the AP reported.\n\nOfficials now believe Kohlhepp is responsible for at least 7 deaths, in addition to the latest kidnapping.\n\nKohlhepp was charged Friday with one count of kidnapping, according to court records. Prosecutor Barry Barnette said in court Friday that the woman saw Kohlhepp shoot and kill her boyfriend and that additional charges were expected, the AP reported.\n\nThe gruesome revelations are a stark contrast to Kohlhepp's professional image. But details from his childhood - particularly his conviction for the 1986 rape of a young teenage girl in Tempe, Arizona - hint at a deeply troubled individual who harbored violent tendencies from an early age, according to court records obtained by the Arizona Republic.\n\nRecords showed that when Kohlhepp was 15 years old he went to a neighbor's house, held a .22-caliber handgun to the 14-year-old girl's head and demanded that she follow him, the Republic reported. Once back at his home, Kohlhepp duct-taped the girl's mouth, restrained her hands and raped her - then told her he would kill her and her younger siblings if she called police, according to the paper.\n\nThe girl reported the rape to police, and Kohlhepp was arrested on kidnapping and sexual assault charges, court records showed. He later took a plea bargain, pleading guilty to just the kidnapping charge, and was sentenced to 15 years in prison.\n\nAn extensive psychiatric evaluation of Kohlhepp, then 16, revealed a sometimes suicidal teenager who saw himself \"as a loner, hostile toward other children and not wanting to be around people,\" according to a report first obtained by Greenville Online.\n\nKohlhepp's parents had divorced when he was a baby, the report said, and he was raised mostly by his mother and stepfather. After they separated in 1982, Kohlhepp began acting out, destroying his room and breaking mirrors so that his mother would send him to live with his biological father.\n\nThe report also detailed a litany of other alleged violent acts from Kohlhepp's childhood. He destroyed his bedroom with a hammer, hit other classmates, was caught \"Cloroxing\" a goldfish, shot a dog with a BB gun and was dismissed from the Boy Scouts because he was too disruptive, the report said.\n\nA teenage Kohlhepp described his father as \"a lier [sic] and preoccupied with guns\" who allegedly taught the boy how to \"blow things up and make bombs,\" according to the report. He had occasionally considered killing his father, whom he accused of physical abuse, but also \"had this rage turned back at himself,\" the report said.\n\nIn the 1987 report, Kohlhepp told the psychiatrist that when police were outside his home to arrest him after the rape of the 14-year-old girl he put the gun to his head and pulled the trigger, but it jammed. \"At this point, he laughed somewhat inappropriately,\" the report said. \"He stated 'Someone doesn't want me to die yet.' \"\n\nKohlhepp seemed conflicted about the rape, alternately describing it as something he was ashamed of but also something that he had done to \"get back\" at his father. The report went on to say that Kohlhepp did not appear to suffer from hallucinations, delusions or other cognitive deficits; in fact, he seemed to be in the \"normal intellectual range\" and \"tended to minimize his problem and expressed hope that he would go back to school and get a GED.\"\n\nThe psychiatrist said there was \"convincing evidence\" that Kohlhepp had borderline personality disorder. \"Throughout the interview, one got the feeling that if he were pushed to any limits, he was potentially explosive,\" the psychiatrist wrote. The psychiatrist also warned that Kohlhepp's \"severe underlying emotional issues ... could result in emotional deterioration in the future or continued aggressive behavior toward others in the future.\""}]}], [{"story_id": 4, "articles": [{"image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/02/us/02xp-desMoines/02xp-desMoines-facebookJumbo.jpg", "summary": "Advertisement Continue reading the main storyAccording to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, killings of officers have risen in the United States this year, and the organization has noted with alarm an increase in \u201cambush killings\u201d of officers.\nThe killings in Iowa also recalled the ambush-style killings of police officers in Brooklyn in December 2014, when two police officers sitting in a patrol car were shot at point-blank range.\n\u201cThere is a clear and present danger to police officers right now.\nSergeant Parizek said that Des Moines police officers would temporarily conduct their patrols in pairs, to afford better protection.\nTen days later, three officers were shot and killed in Baton Rouge, La., by Gavin Long, who had a history of paranoid rantings.", "title": "2 Police Officers Killed in \u2018Ambush-Style\u2019 Attacks in Iowa", "created_at": 1478145600.0, "keywords": ["right", "moines", "des", "iowa", "enforcement", "attacks", "shot", "parizek", "killings", "killed", "ambushstyle", "officers", "law"], "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/03/us/police-iowa-ambush-killed.html", "text": "Video\n\nTwo police officers were shot and killed while sitting in their patrol cars in the Des Moines area early Wednesday, in what the police called \u201cambush-style attacks.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, police officials said they were looking for a man they identified as Scott Michael Greene, 46, a resident of Urbandale, where one of the officers was shot.

In a report covering the first half of the year, the fund said that more than half of the officers fatally shot by suspects were shot in ambushes.\n\nWhile the number of police officers killed by suspects declined last year, that tally has already increased so far this year. In some cases, officers have been killed in high-profile incidents, including ambushes in Dallas and Baton Rouge in July that left eight police officers dead. Those killings also occurred at a time of intense national focus on fatal shootings by police officers, incidents that have prompted protests of law enforcement that, in turn, have caused officers to say they feel vilified and uneasy.\n\nThe Des Moines officer who was slain appears to be the first fatally shot in the line of duty since 1977, according to the police department\u2019s website and records kept by Officer Down Memorial Page, another group that tracks such deaths.\n\nOur thoughts and prayers go out to @UrbandalePolice and @DMPolice officers and their families. pic.twitter.com/4ksZakXk1E \u2014 Ames Police (@AmesPolice) November 2, 2016\n\nThis is the latest tragedy to strike the Des Moines Police Dept.

When Cheatem walked over to Martin\u2019s cruiser, \"I pulled the door open and realized there was nothing I could do for him.\u201d\n\nCheatem said he heard a few more shots a few minutes later, presumably of Beminio getting shot. \u201cIt was the exact same \u2014 pow, pow, pow, pow, pow \u2014 rapid fire,\u201d Cheatem told the newspaper.\n\nMartin probably didn\u2019t know Greene, but other Urbandale officers did, McCarty said.\n\nGreene, who is white, had a history of racist incidents that brought police scrutiny, most recently an Oct. 14 episode in which Urbandale police ejected him from an Urbandale High School football game after he allegedly waved a Confederate flag during the national anthem. Officials said his daughter attends the school.\n\nIn videos uploaded to YouTube last month on an account under Greene\u2019s name, Greene, wearing camouflage, can be seen carrying a Confederate flag and an American flag in front of several black women and later arguing with police officers who told him to leave.\n\nIn a comment under his video, the owner of the account wrote: \u201cI was offended by the blacks sitting through our anthem. Thousands more whites fought and died for their freedom. However this is not about the Armed forces, they are cop haters.\"\n\nQ&A: What we know about ambush cop killings \u00bb\n\nDes Moines Police Sgt.

(Des Moines and Urbandale Police Departments)\n\nGreene complained that officers were violating his constitutional rights.\n\n\u201cI did not want to cause any disruption. I was peacefully protesting,\u201d Greene told the officers in the video, complaining that a black person had smacked him in the head from behind and that someone had snatched a flag out of his hands.\n\nThe officers were initially hesitant to take an assault report from Greene, telling him that he was causing a disturbance and that he had to get off school property, as his flag violated school policy, according to the video.\n\n\u201cYou have to understand, in the current social climate that we\u2019re in, when you fly a Confederate flag, standing in front of several African American people, that\u2019s going to cause a disturbance, OK, whether you intended to or not,\u201d an officer told Greene.\n\nGreene pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in a 2014 incident in which he resisted Urbandale police trying to pat him down for a weapon, according to the Des Moines Register.\n\nDays later, he was accused of accosting a black man in a parking lot, flashing a flashlight into his eyes, calling him the N-word, and threatening to kill him, according to the Register. Greene was charged with first-degree harassment, pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and was sentenced to a year of probation, the newspaper reported.\n\nGreene also had a scheduled court appearance Tuesday stemming from a conflict with his mother, according to McCarty.\n\nTwo Des Moines-area police officers were shot to death early Wednesday in ambush-style attacks while they were sitting in their patrol cars. A suspect has been arrested.\n\nGreene lived at home with his mother and one of his three children, a daughter who is a student and cheerleader at the high school, according to his neighbors, the Nace family.\n\nLast month, about the same time as the flag incident, Greene had an argument with his mother over a pit bull he\u2019d brought home, and he filed a restraining order against his mother to try to get her thrown out of her own house, said Phyllis Nace, 67, who said she often spoke with Greene\u2019s mother.\n\n\u201cShe said that she was filing a restraining order [of her own] to have him get out of her house,\u201d Nace said. \u201cHe wore out his welcome, big time.\u201d\n\nSeveral officers had come by the house during and after the incident, and about a week ago, Nace recalled Greene telling her he \u201cdidn\u2019t trust\u201d police.\n\nBut Nace and her husband, Richard \u201cDoc\u201d Nace, 73, were shocked by the shooting. They said they didn\u2019t recall seeing Greene doing anything unusual around the home, though they said he seemed troubled."}]}], [{"story_id": 5, "articles": [{"image": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "summary": "Further, concerns around securing and retaining key personnel continued in Q3, as did concerns related to leadership succession.\nConcerns among CFOs about oil prices, equity markets and consumer demand have declined since the first quarter of 2016, according to Deloitte\u2019s 2016 Q3 CFO Signals\u2122 survey.\nHowever, the survey of 122 CFOs of large North American companies finds that respondents continue to worry about the U.S. election, regulatory, international trade and tax policies, as well as global economic stagnation, low interest rates and falling commodity prices.", "title": "The Morning Risk Report: France Heralds New Anti-Corruption Law", "created_at": 1478581200.0, "keywords": ["heralds", "worry", "survey", "q3", "prices", "tax", "anticorruption", "concerns", "trade", "cfos", "2016", "risk", "morning", "law", "succession", "report", "france"], "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/riskandcompliance/2016/11/08/the-morning-risk-report-france-heralds-new-anti-corruption-law/", "text": "Concerns among CFOs about oil prices, equity markets and consumer demand have declined since the first quarter of 2016, according to Deloitte\u2019s 2016 Q3 CFO Signals\u2122 survey.

That is definitely possible.\u201d\n\nSome in the industry would prefer to let cities and counties approve temporary licenses to sell recreational pot to avoid delays while people are allowed to possess marijuana.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t fill that vacuum with regulated sales, then people are going to go to the black market,\u201d Bradley said.\n\nThe Legislature will also have to decide whether to reconcile differences between Proposition 64\u2019s regulation of recreational pot and the law approved last year by the Legislature for medical marijuana \u2014 or to have two different regulatory schemes.\n\nThe state is expected to create a task force to look at which rules to merge.\n\nSome of the changes will be easy. The name of the state agency that will regulate and license marijuana sales will immediately change from the current Bureau of Medical Marijuana Regulation to the state Bureau of Marijuana Control to reflect its broader mission.\n\nLori Ajax, who was appointed to head the bureau last spring, is hiring staff and holding public meetings to draft regulations on issues that include licensing.\n\nThe approval of Proposition 64 also triggers a five-year, $15-million study by the California Highway Patrol to develop standards and protocols for determining when a marijuana user is too impaired to safely drive a vehicle.\n\nThe campaign this year had a big advantage over the failed effort of six years ago.

Arizona voted against the measure. In Maine, a state with a libertarian streak that began decriminalizing marijuana decades ago, the referendum on legalization drew scant funded opposition.\n\nStill, proponents of legalization said California would represent the biggest victory because of its huge economy and population and also its fertile soil and amenable climate.\n\nTuesday\u2019s vote reinforced the state\u2019s position as the epicenter of marijuana cultivation for the country, a role it has had illicitly for decades. Marijuana companies have been positioning themselves for the prospect of interstate commerce, buying large plots of land in areas that now grow vegetables and other crops.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe California measure allows people over 21 to possess limited amounts of marijuana for personal use and also permits the personal cultivation of up to six plants in private residences, provided they are shielded from public view.

Here's what they can learn from Washington, Colorado and Oregon, states where marijuana use has already been legalized. (Daron Taylor,Danielle Kunitz/The Washington Post)\n\nCalifornia has long been seen as a bellwether by both supporters and opponents of marijuana reform. The state is home to about 12 percent of the U.S. population. Given the size of the state's economy and the economic impact of the marijuana industry there, California's adoption of legal marijuana could prompt federal authorities to rethink their decades-long prohibition on the use of marijuana.\n\n[A casino magnate is spending millions to fight legal marijuana in three states]\n\nIn a recent interview with Bill Maher, President Obama said that passage of the legalization measures on Tuesday could make the current federal approach to the drug \u201cuntenable.\u201d\n\nStill, the likelihood of a Trump White House leaves a lot of uncertainty about the fate of marijuana measures in the next four years. Under Obama, federal authorities largely took a hands-off approach to state-level legalization efforts. But an incoming administration more skeptical of drug reform could easily reverse that approach.\n\n\u201cThe prospect of Rudy Giuliani or Chris Christie as attorney general does not bode well,\u201d the Drug Policy Alliance's Nadelmann said in an interview. \u201cThere are various ways in which a hostile White House could trip things up.\u201d\n\nNadelmann pointed to the success of marijuana measures in the midst of an evident Republican wave as a sign that support for legalization now cuts deeply across party lines. And citing Trump's often contradictory statements on marijuana and drug use in the past, Nadelmann added that \u201cDonald Trump personally could probably go any which way on this.\u201d\n\nWith today's votes, legal marijuana is also making significant inroads in the Northeast. \u201cMarijuana legalization has arrived on the East Coast,\u201d said Tom Angell of the marijuana reform group Marijuana Majority in an email. \u201cWhat Colorado and other states have already done is generating revenue, creating jobs and reducing crime, so it\u2019s not surprising that voters in more places are eager to end prohibition.\u201d\n\nOpponents of legalization said they were disappointed by the outcomes. \u201cWe were outspent greatly in both California and Massachusetts, so this loss is disappointing, but not wholly unexpected,\u201d said Kevin Sabet of the anti-legalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana in a statement. \u201cDespite having gained considerable ground in the last few weeks, the out-of-state interests determined to make money off of legalization put in too much money to overcome.\u201d\n\nVotes on medical marijuana in Florida and North Dakota were decisive. Florida's Amendment 2 passed with 71 percent support, according to the Associated Press. In North Dakota, the AP reports that 64 percent of voters approving of the medical marijuana measure.\n\n[One striking chart shows why pharma companies are fighting legal marijuana]\n\nTwo years ago, a medical marijuana measure in Florida earned 58 percent of the vote, just shy of the 60 percent threshold needed for passage. Then, as now, opposition to the measure was fueled by multimillion-dollar donations from Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas casino magnate and GOP donor. In 2014 Adelson spent $5.5 million to defeat the measure. This year he's spent $1.5 million in Florida, and several million more to defeat recreational marijuana measures in other states.\n\n\u201cThis is a major tipping point,\u201d said Tom Angell of Florida's vote. \u201cWith Florida's decision, a majority of states in the U.S. now have laws allowing patients to find relief with medical marijuana, and these protections and programs are no longer concentrated in certain regions of the country like the West and Northeast.\u201d\n\nThe victory in North Dakota is something of a surprise as no polling was done on the measure.\n\nThe Florida amendment has the potential to be one of the more permissive medical marijuana regimes in the nation. In addition to diseases like HIV, cancer and PTSD, the measure also allows doctors to recommend medical pot for \u201cother debilitating medical conditions of the same kind or class as or comparable to those enumerated, and for which a physician believes that the medical use of marijuana would likely outweigh the potential health risks for a patient.\u201d While the 2014 measure allowed doctors to prescribe marijuana for any illness they believed it would be useful for, the new measure requires they show the illness is severe \u2014 though the wording gives physicians considerable leeway in determining which conditions would meet those criteria.\n\nThe medical pot measure in North Dakota allows doctors to recommend the drug for a number of severe medical conditions.\n\nWith the passage of Amendment 2, Florida will become the first Southern state to enact a robust medical marijuana regime. Medical marijuana is already legal in 25 other states and the District.\n\n\u201cBetter late than never,\u201d said Ethan Nadelmann, executive director of the drug reform group Drug Policy Alliance, in a statement. \u201cMost states outside the South already have legal medical marijuana, but the overwhelming victory today in Florida is likely to accelerate the momentum for reform throughout the region.\u201d\n\nMore from Wonkblog:\n\nOne striking chart shows why pharma companies are fighting legal marijuana\n\nLegal marijuana is finally doing what the drug war couldn't\n\nOne-fifth of this occupation has a serious drinking problem"}]}, {"story_id": 6, "articles": [{"image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-582219db/turbine/ct-election-results-marijuana-20161108", "summary": "Varying tax rates would be levied on sales, with the money deposited into the state's Marijuana Tax Fund.\nIn this April 20, 2016 file photo, customers buy products at the Harvest Medical Marijuana Dispensary in San Francisco.\nIn Maine, opponents included some major players in the medical marijuana industry who worried about disruptions to their business model.\nElection California Haven Daley / AP In this April 20, 2016 file photo, customers buy products at the Harvest Medical Marijuana Dispensary in San Francisco.\nTwenty-five states allow medical marijuana.", "title": "Marijuana legalization movement faces biggest test yet in 9 states", "created_at": 1478581200.0, "keywords": ["marijuana", "faces", "medical", "states", "recreational", "legalization", "biggest", "drug", "pot", "voters", "movement", "candidate", "presidential", "test"], "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-election-results-marijuana-20161108-story.html", "text": "The movement to legalize marijuana faced its biggest test yet Tuesday as voters in nine states, including the nation's most populous, considered proposals to expand legal access to the drug, which is still forbidden by the federal government.\n\nCalifornia, the first state to approve medical marijuana two decades ago, was among five states weighing whether to go beyond medical use and permit pot for adults for recreational purposes.

In addition to recruiting thousands of people to staff the White House, Cabinet agencies, embassies and other key government posts, the transition team needs to make sure Trump is briefed and prepared to take responsibility for the government and for implementing his policy initiatives as soon as he is inaugurated in just 76 days.\n\n\u201cYou need to have your team on the field when the clock starts,\" said Max Stier, who heads the Partnership for Public Service, a Washington nonprofit that focuses on good-government practices. \"This is not simply about achieving the policy promises; it\u2019s also about keeping us safe. Transitions are the point of maximum vulnerability for our nation.\"\n\nThe effort is almost always well underway before a new president is elected, given the complexity and critical nature of the job, even as candidates know the work will be in vain if they are not chosen by the voters. Legislation passed in 2010, and updated in 2015, formalized much of the process for the transition from George W. Bush to Obama after the 2008 election, considered one of the smoothest in history. Both Trump and Hillary Clinton formed transition teams months ago that began working with the White House on first steps toward a potential handoff.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest dangers is that people will underestimate the scope,\u201d said former Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt, who ran Mitt Romney's transition team in 2012.\n\nThat may have happened in Trump\u2019s case. Following Trump\u2019s meeting Thursday at the White House with the president, several Obama officials privately noted the extent to which Trump and his staff seemed unprepared to discuss basic aspects of staffing a new administration and daunted by the extent of the challenges ahead.

In exit polls, about 1 in 5 voters said the Supreme Court appointments were \u201cthe most important factor\u201d in their decision, and those voters favored Trump by a 57% to 40% margin, according to ABC News.\n\nNow, the court\u2019s ideological balance should remain largely as it has been for the past decade, with Justice Anthony M. Kennedy holding the deciding vote in the court\u2019s biggest cases.\n\nKennedy generally leans to the right on issues such as campaign spending, criminal law, the death penalty, religion, business regulation and gun rights. But he has joined the court\u2019s four liberals to uphold gay rights and to protect blacks from housing discrimination.\n\nCourt disputes over voting laws often divide justices along party lines \u00bb\n\nTrump\u2019s nominee to replace Scalia is not likely to trigger an immediate shift on abortion. In June, Kennedy joined with the liberals to strike down a Texas law that would have forced the closing of most of the state\u2019s abortion clinics, signaling the Roe vs. Wade decision and the right to abortion retains a majority, at least for now.\n\nBut going forward, GOP control of the White House and the Senate means the court could shift strongly to the right in the next four years if Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 83, Kennedy, 80, or Stephen Breyer, 78, were to leave the court.\n\nGinsburg may find herself in an uncomfortable spotlight. Some leading liberals had urged her to retire two years ago so Obama could have filled her seat with a younger liberal justice. Ginsburg said she saw no reason to retire and suggested she was confident another Democrat would follow Obama in the White House.\n\nIf President Trump were to replace Ginsburg or Breyer, it would give the court a dominant conservative bloc with six Republican appointees and no need to rely on Kennedy for some issues, notably abortion and gay rights. Trump said in one debate that he would appoint pro-life justices, and they would overturn Roe vs. Wade.\n\nTrump\u2019s nominees also are likely to be strong supporters of the 2nd Amendment and its right to bear arms. If so, the court could stand as a roadblock against city or state gun regulations, including measures that make it hard for gun owners to obtain concealed carry permits.\n\nShould it be legal to have a congressional district only one party can win? \u00bb\n\nAnd with a new appointee, the court could deal a blow to public sector labor unions. Last year, the conservative justices were prepared to rule in a case involving California teachers and whether it is constitutional to require such employees to pay mandatory fees to support their unions. But Scalia died unexpectedly before the opinion could be issued, leaving the court split, 4-4. Now, conservative activists could bring the issue back to the court.\n\nAnd Trump\u2019s victory likely guarantees the end of Obama initiatives on immigration and climate change. Conservative judges and an evenly divided high court had put those measures on hold.

In exit polls, about 1 in 5 voters said the Supreme Court appointments were \u201cthe most important factor\u201d in their decision, and those voters favored Trump by a 57% to 40% margin, according to ABC News.\n\nNow, the court\u2019s ideological balance should remain largely as it has been for the past decade, with Justice Anthony M. Kennedy holding the deciding vote in the court\u2019s biggest cases.\n\nKennedy generally leans to the right on issues such as campaign spending, criminal law, the death penalty, religion, business regulation and gun rights. But he has joined the court\u2019s four liberals to uphold gay rights and to protect blacks from housing discrimination.\n\nCourt disputes over voting laws often divide justices along party lines \u00bb\n\nTrump\u2019s nominee to replace Scalia is not likely to trigger an immediate shift on abortion. In June, Kennedy joined with the liberals to strike down a Texas law that would have forced the closing of most of the state\u2019s abortion clinics, signaling the Roe vs. Wade decision and the right to abortion retains a majority, at least for now.\n\nBut going forward, GOP control of the White House and the Senate means the court could shift strongly to the right in the next four years if Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 83, Kennedy, 80, or Stephen Breyer, 78, were to leave the court.\n\n\u201cFilling the Scalia seat is probably a wash. But the odds are very high that in four or eight years, President Trump will have other vacancies to fill, and that will be a different story,\u201d said John Malcolm, a legal analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.\n\nGinsburg may find herself in an uncomfortable spotlight. Some leading liberals had urged her to retire two years ago so Obama could have filled her seat with a younger liberal justice. Ginsburg said she saw no reason to retire and suggested she was confident another Democrat would follow Obama in the White House.\n\nIf President Trump were to replace Ginsburg or Breyer, it would give the court a dominant conservative bloc with six Republican appointees and no need to rely on Kennedy for some issues, notably abortion and gay rights. Trump said in one debate that he would appoint pro-life justices, and they would overturn Roe vs. Wade.\n\nTrump\u2019s nominees also are likely to be strong supporters of the 2nd Amendment and its right to bear arms. If so, the court could stand as a roadblock against city or state gun regulations, including measures that make it hard for gun owners to obtain concealed carry permits.\n\nShould it be legal to have a congressional district only one party can win? \u00bb\n\nAnd with a new appointee, the court could deal a blow to public-sector labor unions. Last year, the conservative justices were prepared to rule in a case involving California teachers concerning whether it is constitutional to require such employees to pay mandatory fees to support their unions. But Scalia died unexpectedly before the opinion could be issued, leaving the court split, 4-4. Now, conservative activists could bring the issue back to the court.\n\nAnd Trump\u2019s victory likely guarantees the end of Obama initiatives on immigration and climate change. Conservative judges and an evenly divided high court had put those measures on hold. The court now will soon have a conservative majority to kill those initiatives, assuming they are not repealed first by the Trump administration.\n\nLiberals are worried about what lies ahead. \u201cLonger term, there are real concerns about whether a Supreme Court with two or three Trump-nominated justices would cut back on protections for important fundamental rights and liberties, especially the right of women to meaningfully access abortion,\u201d said Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center. \u201cWe could see a court more willing to look out for corporate interests at the expense of consumers and workers or to break with the guarantees of equality for LGBTQ Americans.\u201d\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump issued two lists of his potential Supreme Court nominees, including judges from state supreme courts and U.S. appeals courts across the nation. They include Florida Supreme Court Justice Charles Canady, who as a congressman sponsored the federal ban on \u201cpartial-birth abortions\u201d; Michigan Supreme Court Justice Joan Larsen, a former Scalia law clerk; 11th Circuit Court Judge William Pryor from Alabama; 7th Circuit Judge Diane Sykes from Wisconsin and Sen.

Ted Strickland in a race that once looked like one of the Democrats' best bets to flip a Senate seat. Portman kept Donald Trump at a distance leading up to Tuesday's election. Nov. 8, 2016. (WKRC)\n\nA New York real estate developer who lives in a sparkling Manhattan high-rise, Trump forged a striking connection with white, working class Americans who feel left behind in a changing economy and diversifying country. He cast immigration, both from Latin America and the Middle East, as the root of problems plaguing many Americans and tapped into fears of terrorism emanating at home and abroad.\n\nGOP Senate candidates fended off Democratic challengers in key states, including North Carolina, Indiana and Wisconsin. Republicans also maintained their grip on the House.\n\nSenate control means Trump will have great leeway in appointing Supreme Court justices, which could shift the bench to the right for decades.\n\nTrump has pledged to usher in sweeping changes to U.S. foreign policy, including building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and suspending immigration from countries with terrorism ties. He has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and spoken of building a better relationship with Moscow, worrying some in his own party who fear he'll go easy on Putin's provocations.\n\nPutin sent him a telegram of congratulations.\n\nTrump upended years of political convention on his way to the White House, leveling harshly personal insults against his rivals, deeming Mexican immigrants rapists and murderers, and vowing to temporarily suspend Muslim immigration to the U.S. He never released his tax returns, breaking with decades of campaign tradition, and eschewed the kind of robust data and field efforts that helped Obama win two terms in the White House, relying instead on his large, free-wheeling rallies to energize supporters. His campaign was frequently in chaos, and he cycled through three campaign managers.\n\nConway, his final campaign manager, touted the team's accomplishments as the final results rolled in, writing on Twitter that \"rally crowds matter\" and \"we expanded the map.\"\n\nClinton spent months warning voters that Trump was unfit and unqualified to be president. But the former senator and secretary of state never sold the nation on her own candidacy.\n\nShe faced persistent questions about her honesty and trustworthiness. Those troubles flared anew late in the race, when FBI Director James Comey announced a review of new emails from her tenure at the State Department. Just two days before Election Day, Comey said there was nothing in the material to warrant criminal charges against Clinton.\n\nTrump will inherit an anxious nation, deeply divided by economic and educational opportunities, race and culture.\n\nExit polls underscored the fractures: Women nationwide supported Clinton by a double-digit margin, while men were significantly more likely to back Trump. More than half of white voters backed the Republican, while nearly 9 in 10 blacks and two-thirds of Hispanics voted for the Democrat.\n\nDoug Ratliff, a 67-year-old businessman from Richlands, Virginia, called Trump's election one of the happiest days of his life.\n\n\"This county has had no hope,\" said Ratliff, who owns strip malls in an area badly beaten by the coal industry's collapse. \"Things will change. I know he's not going to be perfect. But he's got a heart.

The remarks were striking after a campaign in which the Democrats declared Trump was unfit to serve and told voters the future of democracy was riding on their choice.\n\nAn extraordinarily large number of Obama aides and advisers \u2014 more than a hundred in all \u2014 gathered to hear his statement, including stenographers, low-level aides and White House Counsel Neil Eggleston.\n\nThe White House said Obama and Trump are due to meet Thursday to discuss the handover of power and ongoing planning for the transition.

The White House said Obama had \"expressed admiration for the strong campaign she waged throughout the country.\"\n\nIt was unclear how substantive Obama's call was with Trump, or how long it lasted, although the White House noted that Obama placed the call from his residence in the White House, rather than from the West Wing.\n\nTrump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, described it as a \"warm conversation\" and a \"gracious exchange.\" She said Trump had missed the president's original call as Trump was speaking to supporters in New York, then called him back after leaving the stage.\n\nLike Clinton and other Democrats, Obama didn't appear to see Trump's victory coming. As he campaigned vigorously for Clinton in the race's final days, Obama said he was confident that if Americans showed up to vote, they'd choose against electing the billionaire former reality TV star with no formal government experience.\n\nHe had also warned supporters in apocalyptic terms that \"the fate of the republic\" rested on Clinton defeating Trump on Election Day.\n\nCaption Full Donald Trump victory speech Donald Trump's complete victory speech in New York City after he was elected the 45th president of the United States.

Trump will be ensconced in a Hilton a mere 15 blocks away. Clinton is planning a bash in a glass-roofed atrium that is part of the Javits convention center. Trump will be ensconced in a Hilton a mere 15 blocks away.\n\nThere is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in America.\n\nSuch claims have become a regular part of Trump's warnings of a \"rigged election\" \u2014 a central argument from an outsider candidate who has repeatedly challenged the norms of presidential politics.\n\nTrump's outsider status has both hurt and helped him over the last year.\n\nHis political inexperience allowed him to cast himself as a change agent just as frustrated voters in both parties seemed hungry for change. The message was particularly effective against Clinton, a fixture in public service over the last three decades.\n\nYet Trump's inexperience also fueled a series of self-created controversies, whether a days-long public feud with the parents of a slain soldier or late-night tweet storm citing a beauty queen's \"sex tape.\" He insulted opponents from both parties in unusually personal terms, lowering the bar for political discourse in a way never seen before on the national stage.\n\nAnd he was unwilling to embrace the less-glamorous grunt work that typically defines successful campaigns.\n\nThe Republican outsider did little to collect data on prospective supporters. He had no significant staffing presence on the ground in key states. And he refused to invest in a major advertising campaign to keep pace with Clinton.\n\nEver the showman, his strategy relied almost exclusively on massive rallies to connect with voters. He has filled sports arenas, airport hangars and conference centers from Iowa to Michigan to Florida, often with little notice and little organization.\n\nTrump fell $34 million short of his false boast that he spent $100 million of his own money on his election. Publicly available fundraising reports show he put up about $66 million.\n\n\"It was really hard to vote for Donald Trump,\" said Debra Sindler of Savannah, Georgia.\n\nThe 60-year-old real estate agent said she continued to wrestle with even as she walked to the polls. \"I would have never voted for Hillary. And I voted for Donald Trump because I'm concerned about the Supreme Court,\" Sindler said.\n\nAfter voting, Trump spent most of the day behind closed doors, attending a reception with friends and family in the Manhattan skyscraper where he lives and works before heading to a Midtown hotel for his election night party.\n\nAssociated Press"}, {"image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5821d8e8/turbine/ct-election-results-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-20161108", "summary": "The candidates divided the night's first race calls, with Trump carrying reliably Republican Kentucky and Indiana, and Clinton winning liberal Vermont.\n(CBS Chicago) Caption Trump casts ballot Donald Trump voted at a Manhattan polling station on Tuesday as crowds watched outdoors.\nAsked Tuesday in an interview with Fox News if he would accept the election results, Trump continued to demur, saying \"We're going to see how things play out.\"\n(AP) Donald Trump voted at a Manhattan polling station on Tuesday as crowds watched outdoors.\n(AP) Hillary Clinton met with supporters and voters outside a Chappaqua, New York polling station after she cast her ballot in the election.", "title": "AP: Trump takes Indiana, Kentucky; Clinton wins Vermont", "created_at": 1478581200.0, "keywords": ["indiana", "results", "clinton", "ap", "polling", "kentucky", "voters", "takes", "trump", "wins", "race", "states", "vermont", "president", "election", "station"], "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-election-results-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-20161108-story.html#nt=oft01a-3la1", "text": "America's ugly and unpredictable presidential election neared the finish Tuesday, with voters flocking to polls to choose between Democrat Hillary Clinton, hoping to become the first woman to serve as commander in chief, and Republican Donald Trump, the billionaire businessman who tapped into a searing strain of economic populism.\n\nClinton appeared to have multiple paths to triumph, while Trump needed to prevail in most of the battleground states to secure an upset. Control of the Senate was also at stake, with Democrats needing to net four seats if Clinton wins the White House.\n\nThe candidates divided the night's first race calls, with Trump carrying reliably Republican Kentucky and Indiana, and Clinton winning liberal Vermont.\n\nThe 45th president will inherit an anxious nation, deeply divided by economic and educational opportunities, race and culture. The economy has rebounded from the depths of recession, though many Americans have yet to benefit. New terror threats from home and abroad have raised security fears.\n\nClinton asked voters to keep the White House in Democratic hands for a third straight term. She cast herself as heir to President Barack Obama's legacy and pledged to make good on his unfinished agenda, including passing immigration legislation, tightening restrictions on guns and tweaking his signature health care law.\n\n\"I know how much responsibility goes with this,\" Clinton said after voting Tuesday at her local polling station in Chappaqua, New York, with her husband, former President Bill Clinton, at her side. \"So many people are counting on the outcome of this election, what it means for our country, and I will do the very best I can if I'm fortunate enough to win today.\"\n\nTrump, the New York real estate developer who lives in a gold-plated Manhattan penthouse, forged a striking connection with white, working-class Americans who feel left behind in the changing economy and diversifying country. He cast immigration, both from Latin America and the Middle East, as the root of many problems plaguing the nation and called for building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\"I see so many hopes and so many dreams out there that didn't happen, that could have happened, with leadership, with proper leadership,\" he said by telephone on Fox News before casting his own ballot in Manhattan. \"And people are hurt so badly.\"\n\nSeven in 10 Americans who went to the polls Tuesday said immigrants now in the country illegally should be allowed to stay, while just a quarter said they should be deported. More than half oppose building a border wall, according to preliminary results from the exit poll conducted for The Associated Press and television networks by Edison Research.\n\nThe Republican Party's tortured relationship with its nominee was evident right up to the end. Former President George W. Bush and wife Laura Bush declined to back Trump, instead selecting \"none of the above\" when they voted for president, according to spokesman Freddy Ford.\n\nTrump set both parties on edge when he refused to say in the third and final debate whether he would accept the election's results, citing with no evidence the possibility of a rigged outcome. His statement threatened to undermine a fundamental pillar of American democracy and raised the prospect that his fervent supporters would not view Clinton as a legitimate president if she won.\n\nAsked Tuesday in an interview with Fox News if he would accept the election results, Trump continued to demur, saying \"We're going to see how things play out.\"\n\nAccording to the preliminary exit polls, most Americans who voted had at least a moderate amount of confidence that election ballots would be counted accurately.\n\nCaption States to watch in the presidential election With the race for president coming down to the Electoral College results, which states are the ones that bear watching closely?

Many expressed relief the end was in sight after an election season in which personal attacks often drowned out the issues.\n\n\"I'm tired of the mudslinging,\" said Laura Schmitt, a 54-year-old Republican from Woodbury, Minnesota, who was voting for Trump. Emetric Whittington, a 51-year-old Democratic mother of three on Chicago's violence-plagued South Side, agreed: \"I can't wait for this night to be over.\"\n\nClinton has denounced Trump for calling Mexican immigrants \"rapists\" and promoting a ban on Muslims entering the U.S., and for his long line of remarks about women that culminated in an audio in which he bragged about grabbing their genitals. Trump called his opponent \"Crooked Hillary\" for her use of a private email server as secretary of state and her complicated ties to the family's Clinton Foundation.\n\n\"I can't vote for somebody who's so morally reprehensible,\" said Lisa Moore, a 48-year-old Republican from Glen Rock, New Jersey, who picked Clinton. Democrat Charles Ikner of Cross Lanes, West Virginia, opted for Trump, saying it was time for \"fresh blood\" in the White House.\n\nIn the final days, Clinton was buoyed by FBI Director James Comey's weekend declaration that he wouldn't recommend criminal charges against her following a new email review. Comey announced the inquiry late last month, sapping Clinton's surging momentum and threatening Democrats in down-ballot races.\n\nAssociated Press"}]}, {"story_id": 9, "articles": [{"image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-10-26/Getty/618476510.jpg", "summary": "The judge also expressed alarm that the Trump campaign\u2019s filing could be used to try to identify voters, something the Trump campaign denied.\nPeople wait to vote early in Las Vegas last month.\nClark County election officials said that voting machines cannot be separated and sequestered, as requested, because they are already in use again.\nThe lawsuit was filed against Joseph P.

His nominee will be like Scalia in seeking to overturn Roe and be a strong supporter of the Second Amendment, Trump has said.\n\nAll eyes will now be on the court\u2019s oldest members, Kennedy and Ginsburg. Replacing Kennedy with a more stalwart conservative would immediately impact the court\u2019s dynamics. He has given no indication about how long he intends to serve on the court.\n\nGinsburg has said she will serve as long as she is up to the job. She would likely be loath to allow Trump to pick her successor; she caused an uproar this summer when in media interviews she called him a \u201cfaker\u201d and said she feared for the court and the country if he were elected.\n\nGinsburg turned aside calls from some liberals that she retire years ago, so that Obama could name her replacement. She said it was unclear whether the Senate would confirm her successor. And she told The Washington Post that there was no rush: She felt it was likely that another Democrat would be elected after Obama.\n\nRead more:\n\nHow Donald Trump won: The insiders tell their story\n\nA trauamtic campaign produces a shocking ending, with Trump victorious\n\nConsidering what America\u2019s choice of Donald Trump really means"}, {"image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58233f4e/turbine/ct-donald-trump-supreme-court-20161109", "summary": "Caption Full Donald Trump victory speech Donald Trump's complete victory speech in New York City after he was elected the 45th president of the United States.\n(CBS News) Caption Full Donald Trump victory speech Donald Trump's complete victory speech in New York City after he was elected the 45th president of the United States.\n(AP) Caption Trump casts ballot Donald Trump voted at a Manhattan polling station on Tuesday as crowds watched outdoors.\nIn the short term, Republican Donald Trump's victory means that at some point next year, the nine-member court will be restored to full capacity, once again with a majority of Republican-appointed justices.\n(CBS News) Donald Trump's complete victory speech in New York City after he was elected the 45th president of the United States.", "title": "Donald Trump's victory has enormous consequences for the Supreme Court", "created_at": 1478667600.0, "keywords": ["courts", "court", "victory", "consequences", "donald", "york", "republican", "president", "trumps", "enormous", "trump", "supreme", "kennedy"], "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-donald-trump-supreme-court-20161109-story.html#nt=oft13a-27gp1", "text": "The political earthquake that hit Tuesday night has enormous consequences for the Supreme Court, swallowing up Judge Merrick Garland's ill-fated nomination and dismantling Democratic hopes for a liberal majority on the high court for the first time in nearly a half-century.\n\nIn the short term, Republican Donald Trump's victory means that at some point next year, the nine-member court will be restored to full capacity, once again with a majority of Republican-appointed justices.\n\nDemocratic attempts to filibuster Trump's choice would likely lead Republicans to end that option for Supreme Court justices, just as Democrats did for other judicial nominations when their party controlled the Senate.\n\nTrump's upset victory likely changes the court's docket as well: Court challenges to President Barack Obama's regulations regarding the Affordable Care Act and immigration, which have preoccupied the justices in recent terms, will likely disappear under a President Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress.\n\nThe long-term question will be Trump's ultimate impact on the court's membership, and whether he gets the chance to do more than choose the successor to Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February.\n\nTwo of the court's liberals, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G.

Everybody says, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s going to slap 45 percent tariff on everything out of China.\u2019 That\u2019s not what he said, and it\u2019s not what he intends,\u201d Ross said. \u201cWhat he actually said was if it turns out that the Chinese yuan is 45 percent overvalued, or as much as 45, and if they won\u2019t negotiate with us, then it may become necessary as a negotiating measure to threaten them with as much as a 45 percent tariff.\u201d\n\nTrump has railed against the Iranian nuclear deal, promising to undo and renegotiate the agreement as it currently stands.

But just days into his transition to president, Trump seems to be doing the opposite. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post)\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump said that he \u201cwould look at\u201d recognizing Crimea as a part of Russia. The United States and the European Union issued sanctions on Russia over Crimea, and broadened them as a result of Moscow\u2019s involvement in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe president-elect spoke admiringly of Putin during the campaign, praising him as a stronger leader than President Obama and saying the two countries should join together to fight terrorists, particularly the Islamic State in Syria.\n\nThose views put Trump at odds with many GOP defense hawks, who have praised his promise to increase military spending but are uniformly suspicious of Moscow and have denounced Russian actions in Eastern Europe, Ukraine and Syria. The offer of cooperation could also immerse Trump in a deep controversy with the Pentagon, where military and civilian leaders have strongly opposed collaboration with Russia, particularly in Syria.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials have also expressed concern, noting that the Kremlin is believed to have been involved with hacking the email accounts of prominent Democrats, in hopes of injecting chaos into the U.S. electoral process and perhaps swaying the outcome of the vote.\n\nTrump\u2019s conversations with Putin and other world leaders came as protests continued for a sixth straight day in major cities and on college campuses over last week\u2019s election results, in which Trump won the electoral college but lost the popular vote to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\n[Trump called these foreign leaders the day after the election]\n\nHe also faced escalating criticism over his appointment of former Breitbart News head Stephen K. Bannon as chief strategist at the White House. Bannon has been denounced by a chorus of advocacy groups, commentators and congressional Democrats as a proponent of racist, anti-Semitic and misogynistic views.\n\n\u201cBringing Steve Bannon into the White House is an alarming signal that President-elect Trump remains committed to the hateful and divisive vision that defined his campaign,\u201d House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) said in a statement. \u201cThere must be no sugarcoating the reality that a white nationalist has been named chief strategist for the Trump Administration.\u201d Trump allies have dismissed the accusation.\n\nObama, in his first news conference since the election, declined to comment on Bannon and sought to reassure the country and the international community that Trump is committed to governing in a more realistic and pragmatic fashion than he displayed on the campaign trail. Obama said Trump pledged in their conversation last week to maintain U.S. strategic relationships, including the NATO alliance.\n\nAt the same time, Obama urged the president-elect to reach out to groups representing minorities and women, many of whom have felt slighted by his candidacy.\n\n\u201cOne of the great things about the United States is that when it comes to world affairs, the president, obviously, is the leader of the executive branch, the commander in chief, the spokesperson for the nation, but the influence and the work that we have is the result not just of the president. It is the result of countless interactions and arrangements and relationships,\u201d Obama said. \u201c. . . And there is enormous continuity beneath the day-to-day news that makes us that indispensable nation when it comes to maintaining order and promoting prosperity around the world. That will continue.\u201d\n\nTrump has signaled in numerous ways that he will not hew to many of the norms of past presidents, from declining to release his tax returns to relying on his family as key advisers. Previously, he has said he would avoid conflicts of interest as president by turning his business over to his children.\n\n[Trump\u2019s win may just be the beginning of a global populist wave]\n\nSince his victory last week, Trump has received congratulatory calls from a number of foreign leaders, including some he sharply criticized during the presidential race, such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Sunday night, after he spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Trump\u2019s office said that he \u201cbelieves the two leaders will have one of the strongest relationships for both countries moving forward.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s relationship with Russia may be one of his trickiest to navigate.\n\nAlthough the statement released by his office contained few details and did not mention Syria or other specific issues, it said Trump told Putin \u201cthat he is very much looking forward to having a strong and enduring relationship with Russia and the People of Russia.\u201d\n\nIn addition to praising Putin, Trump has indicated that closer relations with Russia would keep the Kremlin from establishing tighter ties with China. He has appeared to absolve Russia from responsibility for intervention in Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea, and during the campaign repeatedly questioned the relevance of NATO, which has charged Moscow with engaging in provocative air and sea actions on the alliance\u2019s eastern flank.\n\nGiving Putin a free pass on those issues would run directly counter to the Russia policy of the Obama administration, which has, among other things, called for an international war-crimes investigation of Russia\u2019s actions in Syria. It could also undermine current European negotiations with Moscow over Ukraine, as well as support for U.S. and European Union sanctions.\n\nRussia is interested not only in getting the sanctions removed but also in obtaining equal status as a player in the Middle East and elsewhere.\n\nMoscow is the primary supporter, along with Iran, of President Bashar al-Assad. In September 2015, one year after the United States began bombing Islamic State targets in Syria, Putin ordered Russian jets into operation against \u201cterrorist\u201d targets there.\n\nMost Russian airstrikes, however, have targeted U.S.-backed opposition forces fighting against Assad and, according to the United Nations, have killed hundreds of civilians. The United States and its European allies have called for an international investigation of Russia for war crimes.\n\nObama administration offers to coordinate U.S. counterterrorism strikes against the Islamic State in Syria with Russia, if the Russians would stop bombing opposition and civilian targets, have repeatedly failed to stop the carnage. Any cooperation with Russia would also put the United States on the side of Iran, whose activities in the region Trump has vowed to stop.\n\nAlso controversial was Trump\u2019s decision Sunday to name Bannon as chief strategist, a move condemned by the Anti-Defamation League, the NAACP, Capitol Hill Democrats and some Republican Trump critics.\n\nTrump\u2019s staff brushed off the criticism Monday, saying Bannon is a former naval officer and Goldman Sachs executive who has been a measured voice behind the scenes at the campaign.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the Steve Bannon that I know, and I\u2019ve spent a lot of time with him,\u201d Trump\u2019s new chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said on MSNBC, responding to allegations of racism, misogyny and anti-Semitism. \u201c. . . He was a force for good on the campaign at every level that I saw, all the time.\u201d\n\nKellyanne Conway, who worked closely with Bannon as Trump\u2019s campaign manager, also defended him. \u201cHe\u2019s been the general of this campaign,\u201d she told reporters as she arrived Monday at Trump Tower in Manhattan to meet with the president-elect.\n\nAsked whether Bannon needed to explain his connections to the alt-right movement, which includes many white nationalists and white supremacists, Conway said: \u201cI\u2019m personally offended that you think I would manage a campaign where that would be one of the going philosophies. It was not \u2014 56 million-plus Americans or so saw something else. . . .

(Reuters)\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump named his top two advisers on Sunday, signaling an aggressive agenda and setting up what could be a battle within the White House between the populist, outsider forces that propelled his winning campaign and the party establishment that dominates Washington.\n\nTrump named Reince Priebus, the head of the Republican National Committee, as his chief of staff. In appointing Priebus, 44, Trump has brought into his White House a Washington insider who is viewed as broadly acceptable by vast swaths of the party, and he signaled a willingness to work within the establishment he assailed on the campaign trail.\n\nBut the president-elect sent an opposing signal by tapping Stephen K. Bannon, his combative campaign chief and former head of the incendiary Breitbart News, as his chief strategist and senior counselor. Bannon, 62, has openly attacked congressional leadership, taking particular aim at House Speaker Paul D. Ryan \u00ad(R-Wis.) \u2014 who recommended Priebus for his new job.\n\n\u201cI am thrilled to have my very successful team continue with me in leading our country,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cSteve and Reince are highly qualified leaders who worked well together on our campaign and led us to a historic victory.

Bannon once called Breitbart \u201cthe platform of the alt-right,\u201d a conservative movement that is a hotbed of white nationalist and anti-Semitic sentiment.\n\nDuring his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump repeatedly vowed to \"drain the swamp\" in D.C. and rid the federal government of political elites and lobbyists. But just days into his transition to president, Trump seems to be doing the opposite. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post)\n\nJonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, said via Twitter on Sunday night: \u201cWe at @ADL_National oppose the appt of Steve Bannon to sr role at @WhiteHouse bc he & his alt-right are so hostile to core American values.\u201d\n\nThe Bannon announcement came as Trump highlighted some of his first priorities in an interview on CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d vowing to \u201cimmediately\u201d deport up to 3 million immigrants who are in the country illegally after he is inaugurated and to simultaneously repeal and replace President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.

Priebus could help Trump notch early legislative victories in a Republican-led Congress and ingratiate himself with the insiders he claims to loathe but who dominate his transition team. A longtime lawyer and Wisconsin political operative, Priebus will work to smooth over residual friction from a campaign during which a number of Republicans refused to endorse Trump, reversed their endorsements or stepped away from him after a 2005 tape surfaced in which Trump is heard saying that he could force himself on women because he was a \u201cstar.\u201d\n\nBannon will be the other voice on Trump\u2019s shoulder: He helped shape Trump\u2019s message on the campaign trail and relishes combativeness.

It could also undermine current European negotiations with Moscow over Ukraine, and support for U.S. and European Union sanctions.\n\nRussia is interested not only in getting the sanctions removed, but also in getting global recognition of equal status as a player in the Middle East and elsewhere.\n\n[Obama says new president-elect is committed to NATO]\n\nEqually controversial was Trump\u2019s selection on Sunday of Bannon.

He will be a great president for all Americans.\u201d\n\n[It\u2019s not just the Cabinet: Trump\u2019s transition team needs to find nearly 4,000 appointees]\n\nThe personnel announcement comes as the contours of the Trump administration are starting to take shape and as he and his team pivot from campaign rhetoric to the nuts and bolts of governing. Trump and his advisers continue to paint a mixed picture of what the administration will look like, and they have been giving answers often at odds with Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric, which included pledges to fully repeal the ACA and get Mexico to pay for a wall along the southern border, and crowd chants of \u201cLock her up!\u201d about his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.\n\nOn undocumented immigrants, Trump said on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that his administration will \u201cget the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, we have a lot of these people, probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million. We are getting them out of our country, or we are going to incarcerate. But we\u2019re getting them out of our country; they\u2019re here illegally.\u201d\n\nThe remarks are another sign of retreat from Trump\u2019s vows throughout much of the presidential campaign to remove all of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the country. By focusing on criminals only, Trump would be mirroring current Obama administration priorities, and experts say his numbers are highly inflated.\n\nTrump also built his campaign around a pledge to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, but he said Sunday he would accept the plan of some congressional Republicans to build a fence in specific places \u2014 something he told MSNBC in February would be acceptable for part of the border because of natural barriers.\n\nTrump again said Sunday that he will probably keep in place parts of the Obama health-care law, including provisions that allow children to stay on their parents\u2019 health plans until the person turns 26 and prevent insurers from refusing coverage for preexisting conditions. He said his administration would work to repeal and replace the law simultaneously; he said in a different interview Friday that the law might simply be amended.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019ll be great health care for much less money. So it\u2019ll be better health care, much better, for less money. Not a bad combination,\u201d he told CBS\u2019s Lesley Stahl on Sunday.\n\nTrump has said that he would appoint Supreme Court justices to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion, and in Vice President-elect Mike Pence he will be bringing one of the nation\u2019s most antiabortion politicians into the White House.\n\nWhen asked by Stahl whether he plans to appoint a justice who will overturn Roe v. Wade, Trump said whomever he names will be \u201cvery pro-life\u201d and that \u201cif it ever were overturned, it would go back to the states.\u201d\n\nTrump also said he is \u201cfine\u201d with same-sex marriage being legal.\n\nThe president-elect, who did not release his tax returns during the campaign, told \u201c60 Minutes\u201d he will make them public \u201cat the appropriate time.\u201d\n\nTrump said he believes that some of the protesters involved in demonstrations that have taken place in major cities since Trump\u2019s victory are \u201cprofessional protesters\u201d and that people shouldn\u2019t be scared of his administration.\n\n[A complicated past lies behind Portland\u2019s violent protests]\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe are going to bring our country back. But certainly, don\u2019t be afraid. You know, we just had an election and sort of like you have to be given a little time.\u201d\n\nWhen asked of reports of racial slurs, harassment and personal threats against African Americans, gay people, Latinos and Muslims and others by some of his supporters, Trump said he didn\u2019t hear it but that he \u201chates\u201d to hear that.\n\n\u201cI am so saddened to hear that. And I say, \u2018Stop it.\u2019 If it \u2014 if it helps. I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: \u2018Stop it,\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nTrump\u2019s personnel announcements are emblematic of the conflicting signals the new administration has sent since Tuesday\u2019s upset victory, in which Trump won the electoral college by sweeping a number of Rust Belt states even as he lost the popular vote. Trump vowed to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of Washington, but numerous lobbyists and big-pocketed donors are appearing in the power structure he is erecting.\n\nTrump defended himself on \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d saying that these people \u201cknow the system right now\u201d but that it is going to be phased out.\n\nThe president-elect appears to have resumed full use of his Twitter account, which was restricted leading up to Election Day. He took aim at the New York Times, suggesting that a letter sent to subscribers amounted to the paper \u201capologizing for their BAD coverage of me.\u201d The letter did not apologize for bad coverage.\n\nTrump suggested on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that he might not tweet as much when he occupies the Oval Office \u2014 or just not in the way the world has gotten used to.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to do very restrained, if I use it at all, I\u2019m going to do very restrained. I find it tremendous. It\u2019s a modern form of communication,\u201d he said.\n\nAndrew Roth in Moscow contributed to this story."}]}, {"story_id": 10, "articles": [{"image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/files/2016/11/trump-60-mins.png&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "summary": "The \"60 Minutes\" interview will be broadcast on CBS at 7 p.m. Eastern time on Sunday, Nov. 13.\nShe just said, 'Congratulations, Donald, well done,'\" Trump told Stahl.\nIn the interview with Stahl, Trump did not rule out calling both of the Clintons for advice during his term.\n\u201cShe couldn\u2019t have been nicer,\u201d Donald Trump says of his post-election call w/Hillary Clinton.\nSeated with his wife, Melania, and his four children, Trump spoke to 60 Minutes correspondent Lesley Stahl in his first televised interview since winning the election this week.", "title": "Donald Trump on \u201960 Minutes\u2019: Hillary Clinton \u2018couldn\u2019t have been nicer\u2019", "created_at": 1478926800.0, "keywords": ["60", "hillary", "nicer", "going", "couldnt", "trump", "told", "stahl", "try", "minutes", "act", "interview", "donald", "clinton"], "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/12/donald-trump-on-60-minutes-hillary-clinton-couldnt-have-been-nicer/", "text": "\u201cShe couldn\u2019t have been nicer,\u201d Donald Trump says of his post-election call w/Hillary Clinton. \u201cShe is very strong\u201d https://t.co/SeZpwfZZXN pic.twitter.com/4k7ZaLo0Nl \u2014 60 Minutes (@60Minutes) November 12, 2016\n\nIn a \"60 Minutes\" interview scheduled to air Sunday, President-elect Donald Trump shifted his position on Obamacare, saying he would try to preserve key parts of the healthcare act, and also praised Hillary Clinton as \"very strong and very smart.\"\n\nSeated with his wife, Melania, and his four children, Trump spoke to 60 Minutes correspondent Lesley Stahl in his first televised interview since winning the election this week.\n\nTrump told Stahl that Clinton's phone call conceding the election was \"lovely\" and acknowledged that making the phone call was likely \"tougher for her than it would have been for me,\" according to previews of the interview released by CBS.\n\n\"She couldn\u2019t have been nicer.

Among other insults, Trump also referred to his competitor as \"the devil,\" \"a bigot\" and -- at the tail end of the final presidential debate -- \"such a nasty woman.\"\n\nTrump also told Stahl that former president Bill Clinton called him the following day and \"couldn't have been more gracious.\"\n\n\"He said it was an amazing run -- one of the most amazing he's ever seen,\" Trump said. \"He was very, very, really, very nice.\"\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump had tried to use Bill Clinton's infidelities as a way to attack and embarrass Hillary Clinton. For the second presidential debate, Trump had sought to intimidate his competitor by inviting women who had accused the former president of sexual abuse to sit in the Trump family box. Debate officials quashed the idea.\n\nIn the interview with Stahl, Trump did not rule out calling both of the Clintons for advice during his term.\n\n\"I mean, this is a very talented family,\" he said. \"Certainly, I would certainly think about that.\"\n\nTrump also reiterated on \"60 Minutes\" that he may keep portions of the Affordable Care Act, something he had mentioned he might do after meeting with President Barack Obama in the White House on Thursday.\n\nWhen Stahl asked whether people with pre-existing conditions would still be covered after Trump repealed and replaced Obamacare, Trump said they would \"because it happens to be one of the strongest assets.\""}]}, {"story_id": 10, "articles": [{"image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58295cee/turbine/la-na-pol-trump-immigration-20161113", "summary": "Given his leadership there, Bannon\u2019s ascension to the White House was immediately condemned on both sides of the aisle.\nAdam Schiff (D-Burbank), the ranking member on the House intelligence committee, called the move \u201cunsurprising but alarming,\u201d saying Bannon\u2019s views have no place in the White House.\nBannon, 62, was executive director of Breitbart News when he took a leave of absence in August to lead Trump\u2019s campaign.\nA news release issued by Trump\u2019s presidential transition office said Bannon and Priebus will serve as \"equal partners.\u2019\u2019 Neither position is subject to Senate confirmation.\nTrump\u2019s estimate of how many immigrants have criminal records exceeds what others have found.", "title": "Trump names Priebus and Bannon as top White House aides and says deportations will begin immediately", "created_at": 1479013200.0, "keywords": ["deportations", "aides", "campaign", "begin", "records", "trump", "names", "million", "house", "priebus", "bannon", "criminal", "immediately", "trumps", "white"], "url": "http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-immigration-20161113-story.html#nt=notification", "text": "Donald Trump made his first significant moves as the nation\u2019s president-elect on Sunday, naming two campaign insiders with sharply contrasting approaches as his top White House aides while also signaling that he will seek to promptly deport up to 3 million immigrants with \"criminal records\u2019\u2019 who are in the U.S. illegally.\n\nThe rapid-fire developments highlighted the challenges Trump faces in reconciling the rhetoric that helped propel him to victory with how he is prepared to govern.\n\nThe tension between passion and pragmatism played out vividly with Trump\u2019s selection of his often-provocative campaign operative, former Breitbart News executive Stephen K.
