For example, Uber says that for each driver in the US, it checks county courthouse records going back 7 years for every county of residence, federal courthouse records going back 7 years, multi-state criminal database going back 7 years, the National Sex Offender Registry screen, Social Security Trace (lifetime), and motor vehicle records (historical and ongoing).\n\nBut protests have occurred in cities from Boston to London to Paris, with many taxi drivers complaining Uber violates local taxi rules.

Cities around the world are calling into question driver screening processes for Uber, as well as similar ride-sharing services including Lyft and Sidecar.\n\nAnd the India case is just one of many in a series of sexual assault charges Uber has faced recently, including accusations a driver assaulted a passenger in Washington, D.C. in July.\n\nRegulators in California have threatened Uber, Lyft, and Sidecar with letters saying the companies are violating California business law and that the service has misled users on the extent to which it checks drivers' backgrounds, the Monitor previously reported.\n\nThe district attorneys said the services performed sub-par background checks on drivers that fail to properly screen out people with past driving violations and criminal offenses.\n\nThe companies argue they should not be regulated by government's outdated rules. \"The district attorneys are trying to enforce laws written for limousines, in an era before smartphones,\" a Sidecar spokeswoman said in a statement.\n\nUber insists that its background checks on drivers are often more rigorous than state or local regulations require for licensed taxis. For example, Uber says that for each driver in the US, it checks county courthouse records going back 7 years for every county of residence, federal courthouse records going back 7 years, multi-state criminal database going back 7 years, the National Sex Offender Registry screen, Social Security Trace (lifetime), and motor vehicle records (historical and ongoing).\n\nBut protests have occurred in cities from Boston to London to Paris, with many taxi drivers complaining Uber violates local taxi rules. They have pointed out the company does not require its drivers to meet proper licensing and safety regulations.\n\nOf course, some licensed taxi drivers in Miami are switching to working for Uber because only 20 percent of each fare goes to Uber (vs. up to 80 percent for regulated taxi companies), and Uber offers drivers and their cars full commercial insurance coverage from the moment they turn on their app and accept a ride. Most taxi drivers have to pay for their own insurance coverage.\n\nYet, accusations are stacking up, and many are asking why Uber isn't doing a better job screening or policing their drivers.\n\nAfter driver hit and killed a six-year-old girl in San Francisco, Uber responded he was not working for Uber at the time of the incident, The Daily Beast reported, \"sparking something of a debate about what 'working for Uber' really means.\"", "html": "<html><body><div><div id=\"story-body\" class=\"eza-body clearfix p402_premium\">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p>After <a href=\"/csmlists/topic/New+Delhi\" title=\"Title: New Delhi\" target=\"_self\" class=\"inform_link\" rel=\"nofollow\">New Delhi</a> banned Uber from operating in the city Monday following rape accusations, the latest in the saga involving the taxi booking service is raising fresh questions about passenger safety and the company's screening process for drivers around the world.</p><p>The 32-year-old suspect, who allegedly raped a woman before driving her home, had previously been jailed for rape, though he claims he was acquitted of those charges in 2011.</p><p>A New Delhi <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Latest-News-Wires/2014/1208/Uber-banned-in-New-Delhi-after-driver-rape-accusation\" target=\"_self\">court ordered Shiv Kumar Yadav held for three days</a> for police questioning over allegations that he raped the finance company employee after being hired to ferry her home from a dinner engagement on Friday night, according to the <a href=\"/csmlists/topic/The+Associated+Press\" title=\"Title: The Associated Press\" target=\"_self\" class=\"inform_link\" rel=\"nofollow\">Associated Press</a>.</p><p>The CEO of San Francisco-based Uber, Travis Kalanick, said the company would do \"everything to bring the perpetrator to justice and to support the victim and her family in her recovery,\" the Associated Press reported.</p><div id=\"story-embed-column\" class=\"pull_right p402_hide\"><aside id=\"story-inset\"><div id=\"story-inset-0\" class=\"ezc-csm_quiz\"><div class=\"inset_block ezc-csm_quiz\">\n<div class=\"story_thumbnail\"><a href=\"/USA/2014/0710/Do-you-belong-on-the-road-Take-our-driver-s-test\"><img src=\"/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/content/2014/0709-driving/18702770-1-eng-US/0709-driving_standard_218x145.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"/></a></div>\n\n</div></div>\n<div id=\"story-inset-1\" class=\"ezc-csm_gallery\"><div class=\"inset_block ezc-csm_gallery\">\n<div class=\"story_thumbnail\"><a href=\"/Photo-Galleries/Photos-of-the-Day/2014/Photos-of-the-day-12-08\"><img src=\"/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/content/2014/900/19361765-1-eng-US/900_standard_218x145.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"/></a></div>\n\n</div></div></aside></div><p>Kalanik also said the company would work with the government to establish clear background checks that are \"currently absent in their commercial transportation licensing programs.\"</p><p>It was not immediately clear if Uber itself performed any background checks, nor was it clear whether Mr. Yadav would even have been flagged.</p><p>The New Delhi ban is a blow for Uber, which has courted acclamation and controversy around the world with a service based on hailing taxis from a smartphone app. It has faced restrictions in other countries after licensed taxi operators claimed the service was competing unfairly.</p><p>The service, which uses private cars rather than licensed cabs, promises a quicker response time than licensed cabs \u2013 often less than 10 minutes.

On its website, it describes its background checks as \"often more rigorous\" than those in the traditional taxi industry.\n\nBut in statehouses across the country, Uber has fought against legislation requiring background checks as strong as those demanded of traditional taxis. Other ride-sharing companies like Lyft and Sidecar, Uber's chief rivals, have also pushed against the laws, but supporters of stronger background checks say Uber has been by far the most aggressive.\n\nIn Colorado, the company helped persuade lawmakers to ease drivers' background checks in a bill that legalized ride-sharing companies. In Illinois, after a lobbying push, Gov. Pat Quinn vetoed a bill that would have forced Uber to strengthen those checks.\n\nAnd in California, Uber and other companies like it helped kill a law that would have required drivers to undergo a background check by the state's Justice Department, as is required of taxi drivers.\n\nAt the same time, the rigor of Uber's checks has come into question. On Monday, Uber was banned in New Delhi after a driver was accused of raping a customer; New Delhi authorities said the driver, who was previously accused of raping another female passenger in 2011, was not properly vetted by Uber.\n\n\"We don't know if their background checks are good, bad or indifferent,\" said Max Tyler, a Colorado state representative who is critical of Uber's approach to rider safety. \"In Colorado, the bill did not have an F.B.I. background check, no fingerprint check, none of the things taxi drivers must go through.\"\n\n\"Maybe Uber is doing a good job vetting drivers, maybe not,\" he added.\n\n\"Uber is on track to complete more than two million background checks in 2014,\" said Lane Kasselman, an Uber spokesman. \"It's a responsibility we take seriously.\"\n\nErin Simpson, a Lyft spokeswoman, said that safety was Lyft's \"top priority\" and that its checks \"far exceed what's required for taxis and limos in nearly every municipality across the country.\"\n\nUber, a five-year-old company that has raised about $2.7 billion in cash and is valued by investors at over $40 billion, is in the limelight these days. It is expanding at breakneck speed, hiring thousands of drivers in more than 250 cities worldwide, with rumors of an eventual public offering. It has vast ambitions \u2014 to become a delivery service replacing not just taxis but couriers like the United Parcel Service, and grocery and restaurant delivery services.\n\nAt the same time, though, it is facing scrutiny. Attention intensified last month, after an Uber executive said the company should dig up dirt on reporters critical of its business. Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, has demanded that the company explain its privacy policies.\n\nOn Monday, a Dutch court barred UberPop, the company's low-cost service, from operating in the Netherlands; that same day, the city of Portland, Ore., sued Uber, saying it was operating an \"illegal, unregulated transportation service.\" In Spain on Tuesday, a judge issued a temporary ban against Uber's operations after protests from the country's taxi associations.\n\nBackground checks have become a hot point of debate, with the New Delhi case just the most recent to raise the issue.\n\nThis year, an Uber driver who had been convicted of reckless driving in Florida was arrested in San Francisco in the death of a 6-year-old girl. The child's family filed a wrongful-death suit. On Monday, the driver was charged with misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter.\n\nLast year, an Uber driver was accused of assaulting a passenger in San Francisco; he was previously convicted of a felony drug charge, an offense that should have disqualified him from working for Uber under its own procedures.\n\nThe push in state capitals against background checks is a reflection of how Travis C. Kalanick, Uber's founder and chief executive, has made it a top priority to navigate laws that he says are outdated and protected by the taxi industry, and that would slow Uber's growth. In August, he hired David Plouffe, who helped President Obama win the presidency, because, he said, \"we are in the middle of a political campaign and it turns out the candidate is Uber.\"\n\nBut lawmakers say that in the rush to add drivers, Uber and Lyft are choosing speed over quality in background checks.\n\nUber uses Hirease, a private company that says it has an average turnaround time of \"less than 36 hours.\" Sterling, Lyft's private background check service, says its turnaround time averages two business days.\n\nBoth services do drug and alcohol testing, but neither does fingerprint testing. And they rely primarily on publicly available information.\n\nAlthough state background checks for taxi drivers vary by jurisdiction, lawmakers say they are generally more rigorous than either of these services. They usually include searches of private databases like F.B.I. records, gaining consent from prospective drivers for those searches, said Adrin Nazarian, a California assemblyman who has pushed for stronger vetting laws.\n\nIn February, Mr. Nazarian sponsored a bill to require companies like Uber to put their drivers through the same process facing traditional taxi drivers. In California, those drivers must undergo checks by the state's Justice Department, including fingerprint scanning, drug and alcohol testing, and searches of private databases. A check can take as little as three days, but as long as eight weeks.\n\n\"No private background check can compete with state-run background checks,\" Mr. Nazarian said. \"I don't see how anyone can fight with a straight face about not wanting to have the best background check.\"\n\nMr. Kasselman, the Uber spokesman, said the private services procured better data because in reviewing the local, state and federal backgrounds of drivers, they go to \"the source of the records rather than relying on databases that may not always be up-to-date.\"\n\nHe added that a continuing external audit of Uber's procedures had found that the company's methodology was an improvement over traditional taxi background checks. The audit is being performed by Giuliani Partners, the consulting firm founded by Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York.\n\nThe taxi and limousine industry backed the bill, and various transportation interests spent more than $1.3 million to support it, assembly records show. Transportation industry interests have also contributed to the campaigns of more than 20 members of the California Assembly, including Mr. Nazarian.\n\nUber and Lyft hired lobbyists and organized a public relations campaign. Uber, which has spent over $650,000 lobbying on California transportation issues, characterized the bill as little more than \"a flagrant attempt to stymie innovation and competition by an antiquated industry.\" In the summer, nearly 100 drivers and passengers protested the bill on the Assembly steps.\n\nIn Colorado, Uber spent about $60,000 on lobbyists to support legislation that in June made the state one of the first to legalize companies like Uber and Lyft. That law does not require such drivers to undergo the same strict fingerprint checks required of taxi and limousine drivers.\n\nIn May, Illinois legislators passed two bills, supported by the taxi industry, that more heavily regulated ride-sharing services, including requiring state-conducted background checks for drivers.\n\nAfter the bills were passed, Uber hired lobbyists, including Jack Lavin, the former chief of staff of Governor Quinn. In August, the governor vetoed the bills, saying the industry \"is best regulated at the local level.\"\n\nHis office did not respond to a request for further comment; Mr. Lavin did not respond either.\n\nA new version of the legislation that would loosen background check restrictions on Uber drivers, as the Colorado law does, recently passed the Illinois House and Senate.\n\nOn Tuesday, the district attorney of San Francisco, George Gasc\u00f3n, announced that he had filed a civil suit against Uber, saying the company had misled consumers about its background checks. Lyft settled similar claims with the district attorney.\n\n\"You are not using an 'industry-leading' background check process if you are not fingerprinting your drivers,\" Mr. Gasc\u00f3n said at a news conference.", "html": "<html><body><div><div id=\"story-body\" class=\"story-body\">\n\n        \n        \n        <div class=\"lede-container\">\n            <figure id=\"media-100000003282486\" class=\"media photo lede layout-large-horizontal\" data-media-action=\"modal\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope=\"\" itemid=\"http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/10/business/Uber/Uber-master675.jpg\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\" aria-label=\"media\" role=\"group\">\n    <span class=\"visually-hidden\">Photo</span>\n    <div class=\"image\">\n            <img src=\"http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/10/business/Uber/Uber-master675.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"media-viewer-candidate\" data-mediaviewer-src=\"http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/10/business/Uber/Uber-superJumbo.jpg\" data-mediaviewer-caption=\"Taxi drivers protesting ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft, as well as a California Assembly bill that would require such companies to insure their drivers, at the State Capitol in Sacramento.\" data-mediaviewer-credit=\"Max Whittaker/Reuters\" itemprop=\"url\" itemid=\"http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/10/business/Uber/Uber-master675.jpg\"/>\n            <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"450\"/>\n            <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"675\"/>\n    </div>\n        <figcaption class=\"caption\" itemprop=\"caption description\">\n                <span class=\"caption-text\">Taxi drivers protesting ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft, as well as a California Assembly bill that would require such companies to insure their drivers, at the State Capitol in Sacramento.</span>\n                        <span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">\n            <span class=\"visually-hidden\">Credit</span>\n            Max Whittaker/Reuters        </span>\n            </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n            \n        </div>\n\n                                    \n                        \n        <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"201\" data-total-count=\"201\" itemprop=\"articleBody\" id=\"story-continues-1\">Uber champions its \u201cindustry-leading standards\u201d for vetting its drivers.

It is expanding at breakneck speed, hiring thousands of drivers in more than 250 cities worldwide, with rumors of an eventual public offering.

Kalanick, Uber\u2019s founder and chief executive, has made it a top priority to navigate laws that he says are outdated and protected by the taxi industry, and that would slow Uber\u2019s growth. In August, he hired David Plouffe, who helped President Obama win the presidency, because, he said, \u201cwe are in the middle of a political campaign and it turns out the candidate is Uber.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"118\" data-total-count=\"4447\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">But lawmakers say that in the rush to add drivers, Uber and Lyft are choosing speed over quality in background checks.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"216\" data-total-count=\"4663\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Uber uses Hirease, a private company that <a title=\"About the company.\" href=\"http://www.hirease.com/solutions/accredited-background-screening/\"> says it has</a> an average turnaround time of \u201cless than 36 hours.\u201d Sterling, Lyft\u2019s private background check service, <a title=\"About the company.\" href=\"http://www.acxiomicheck.com/FAQ.aspx\">says its turnaround time</a> averages two business days.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"139\" data-total-count=\"4802\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Both services do drug and alcohol testing, but neither does fingerprint testing. And they rely primarily on publicly available information.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"370\" data-total-count=\"5172\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Although state background checks for taxi drivers vary by jurisdiction, lawmakers say they are generally more rigorous than either of these services.

In California, those drivers must undergo checks by the state\u2019s Justice Department, including fingerprint scanning, drug and alcohol testing, and searches of private databases. A check can take as little as three days, but as long as eight weeks.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"213\" data-total-count=\"5786\" itemprop=\"articleBody\" id=\"story-continues-7\">\u201cNo private background check can compete with state-run background checks,\u201d Mr. Nazarian said. \u201cI don\u2019t see how anyone can fight with a straight face about not wanting to have the best background check.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"266\" data-total-count=\"6052\" itemprop=\"articleBody\" id=\"story-continues-8\">Mr. Kasselman, the Uber spokesman, said the private services procured better data because in reviewing the local, state and federal backgrounds of drivers, they go to \u201cthe source of the records rather than relying on databases that may not always be up-to-date.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"300\" data-total-count=\"6352\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">He added that a continuing external audit of Uber\u2019s procedures had found that the company\u2019s methodology was an improvement over traditional taxi background checks.

Giuliani, the former mayor of New York.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"301\" data-total-count=\"6653\" itemprop=\"articleBody\" id=\"story-continues-9\">The taxi and limousine industry backed the bill, and various transportation interests spent more than $1.3 million to support it, assembly records show.

Uber, which has spent over $650,000 lobbying on California transportation issues, characterized the bill as little more than \u201ca flagrant attempt to stymie innovation and competition by an antiquated industry.\u201d In the summer, nearly 100 drivers and passengers protested the bill on the Assembly steps.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"14\" data-total-count=\"7044\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">The bill died.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"285\" data-total-count=\"7329\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">In Colorado, Uber spent about $60,000 on lobbyists to support legislation that in June made the state one of the first to legalize companies like Uber and Lyft.

To bring these new drivers onto its platform, Uber uses an outside private firm to screen prospective candidates.\n\nUber characterizes the practice as \"industry-leading\" on its website but San Francisco and Los Angeles officials say this is not the case.\n\n\"Uber does not go above and beyond local requirements in every city in which it operates,\" George Gasc\u00f3n, the district attorney of San Francisco, said at a news conference on Tuesday.\n\nIn the screening process, Uber and Lyft, another ride-hailing service, do not require drivers to submit their fingerprints for a background check, which the California officials say is the most comprehensive form of driver screening methodology.\n\n\"You are not using an industry-leading background process if you are not fingerprinting your drivers,\" Mr. Gasc\u00f3n said.\n\nEva Behrend, a spokeswoman for Uber, said in a statement that the company had met with the district attorneys and would continue discussions with them regarding their concerns.\n\n\"Californians and California lawmakers all agree \u2014 Uber is an integral, safe and established part of the transportation ecosystem in the Golden State,\" Ms. Behrend said.\n\nThe suit comes at an inopportune time for Uber, which has been under fire for its driver screening procedures. On Monday, the service was banned in the Delhi region of India after an Uber driver was accused of raping one of his passengers.

Policemen escort driver Shiv Kumar Yadav (C in black jacket) who is accused of a rape outside a court in New Delhi December 8, 2014.\n\nThe move in India was followed by separate government and court actions against Uber in Thailand, Spain and the United States on a variety of issues.\n\nThe rape case in India has caused uproar after it emerged that the suspect had previously been charged for rape but had obtained a character reference signed by a police officer that was forged.\n\nIt has also revealed a failure to regulate the booming market for app-based taxi services in India. The Delhi transport department said it ordered Uber to cease operations on Monday by post.\n\n\"Such service providers which are not licensed ... are prohibited to operate till they get themselves registered,\" Home Minister Rajnath Singh told parliament, where several lawmakers grilled him over the lack of women's safety in the capital.\n\n\"The Delhi Police is also exploring the issue of possible legal liability of the taxi service Uber in the crime committed,\" he said.\n\nSingh's comments came after New Delhi's transport division banned Uber and other similar web-based taxi providers that are unregistered. A public notice on Tuesday stated only six radio taxi companies will operate in New Delhi.\n\nIn Thailand on Tuesday transport authorities ordered the company to cease operations, saying drivers picking up fare-paying passengers via Uber were neither registered nor insured to drive commercial vehicles.\n\nIn Spain, a judge ordered Uber to cease operations as a local taxi association prepared a case accusing it of unfair competition.\n\nIn Chicago, police said they were investigating an allegation that an Uber driver raped a female customer. Uber said it was cooperating with police and called the incident \"appalling.\"\n\nIn California prosecutors said that a former Uber driver was charged with misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter in the death of a 6-year-old girl who was struck in a San Francisco crosswalk on New Year's Eve.\n\nTaxi booking apps have irked drivers at traditional taxi firms across the globe. Consumers are increasingly using the smartphone software to find people willing to drive them, rather than booking a cab by phone.\n\nUber was blacklisted in New Delhi on Monday after police said it had failed to run background checks on the driver, who was held three years ago on suspicion of rape but later acquitted.\n\nThe arrested driver, Shiv Kumar Yadav, appeared in court on Monday and was remanded in custody for three days. Yadav had obtained a reference from the Delhi Police, but the deputy commissioner of police for north Delhi Madhur Verma told Reuters it was forged.\n\nVerma also said the police had registered \"a case against Uber for cheating its customers and violating government orders\".\n\nThe Uber case has reignited a debate about the safety of women in Asia's third-largest economy, especially New Delhi, which is often dubbed India's rape capital.\n\nIn 2012, a fatal gang rape of a young woman taking public transport in the city led to nationwide protests and forced the government to enact laws imposing stricter penalties and formation of fast-track courts.\n\nUber was valued at $40 billion last week after its latest funding round ahead of an expected initial public offering.

That option also exists for those who live more than 40 miles from a VA facility. This $10 billion provision enables a sort of \"surge capacity\" that \"promises to increase veterans' options for timely, high-quality care,\" says Katherine Kidder, research associate at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank.\n\nOn the other hand, she warns, \"it outsources the VA's responsibility and removes some of the pressure to reform.\"\n\nQ. What about the need to beef up services within the VA?\n\nIn the last four years, 2 more million veterans have entered the VA system, with a net increase of 1.5 million more patients, according to Acting VA Secretary Sloan Gibson. The legislation provides $5 billion to pay for more doctors and nurses and deal with space restrictions in crowded facilities. The VA will be allowed to lease at least 27 medical facilities to help provide access that is closer to home for many veterans, and increase the availability of specialty care.\n\nQ. Will the bill get at records falsification that covered up long wait times?\n\n\"We have all been outraged by the manipulation of waiting-time data and by the dishonesty of some VA officials, and by the retaliation against whistle-blowers who tried to expose serious problems,\" Senator Sanders said at a press conference unveiling the agreement Monday. The bill gives the VA secretary new authority to immediately remove incompetent senior executives \u2013 without pay \u2013 while also providing those who have been laid off a week to appeal, and then a 21-day review period for a decision.\n\nQ. Who is going to be the new head of the VA?\n\nRobert McDonald, the former CEO of Proctor & Gamble, has gotten a warm reception on the Hill and is expected to be confirmed by the Senate this week. Mr. McDonald is an Army veteran, and comes from a family of veterans. At his Senate confirmation hearing last week, he cited cultural and moral challenges at the VA, such as integrity, transparency, and accountability, in addition to the challenge of timely access to care.\n\n\"The VA is in crisis. The veterans are in need. There is a lot of work to do to transform the department and it will not be easy, but it is essential and can be achieved,\" he said last week.\n\nQ. What are the potential pitfalls with the compromise?\n\nSpending is one. Because the long waiting times are viewed as a current emergency, the bill relies on emergency spending for funding. This could be a deal-killer among debt-conscious conservatives in the House, but a nod has been made to them by finding $5 billion in VA offsets out of the total $17 billion.\n\nRepresentative Miller jokingly told reporters he comes from a sales background, and that he can deliver the sale \u2013 though it won't be unanimous among Republicans.\n\nMs. Kidder says the issue is less one of funding, and much more of allocation \u2013 how money is spent and how the VA is managed. The backlog problems are occurring in a massive agency with an annual budget of more than $150 billion, she points out.\n\nAnother potential problem would be if, given the choice, veterans choose to flee the VA \u2013 like parents choose charter schools over public schools. But both chairmen cited studies that show once veterans are inside the system, they are generally pleased with it. The problem is getting timely access to the system.\n\nQ. How did this agreement come about in such a partisan climate?\n\nThree things worked in favor of the deal: a national crisis and scandal that called out for bipartisanship; the strong desire to address this issue before the August recess; and the very issue of caring for America's veterans. Lawmakers may not be able to agree on immigrants, but they can usually find a way to rally around those who have sacrificed to protect the nation.\n\nEven at last week's low point, both senators and their staffs kept talking with each other. \"We continued to communicate,\" Miller said.", "html": null, "created_at": 1406606605.417, "image": "http://www.csmonitor.com/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/content/2014/0728-vets/18781670-1-eng-US/0728-vets.png", "title": "VA fix 101: what the $17 billion emergency bill would do (+video)", "feed_id": 12, "updated_at": 1406606605.417, "source_id": 4, "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/DC-Decoder/2014/0728/VA-fix-101-what-the-17-billion-emergency-bill-would-do-video", "id": 7153}, {"text": "The chairmen of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs in the Senate and House announced an agreement Monday on a $17 billion emergency veterans bill that seeks to address a national care crisis.\n\nAs proof that bipartisanship in Congress is still possible, a key liberal senator and his Republican counterpart in the House announced an agreement Monday on a $17 billion emergency veterans bill that last week was caught in partisan crossfire.\n\nThe bill seeks to address a national care crisis of long waits for treatment, falsified records, and reports of related deaths that led to the resignation of Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki on May 30.\n\nThe Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America expressed support for the agreement, which was announced by the chairmen of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs in the Senate and House, Sen.

Robin Konrad, one of Wood's legal team, attempted to convince Neil Wake, an Arizona district judge, to halt the execution and order prison officials to start lifesaving techniques.\n\n\"Mr Wood's execution started at 1.52. He was being sedated at 1.57. Since that time he has been gasping, snorting, and unable to breathe and not dying. And we're asking \u2013 our motion asks for you to issue an emergency stay and order the Department of Corrections to start lifesaving techniques as required under their protocol,\" Konrad told the judge.\n\nJeffrey Zick of the Arizona attorney general's office was on the call and tried to assure the judge that Wood was unconscious: \"The individual who does the consciousness check determined, medically determined that Mr Wood was unconscious; that his mouth was open; that at some point during the \u2013 when the drugs were given, an involuntary reaction or a snoring-type reaction was taking place; that it had been ongoing. A second consciousness check was given. He is unconscious.\"\n\nHowever, when Zick claimed he was told that Wood \"is effectively brain dead ... the brain stem is working but there is no brain activity\", the judge questioned how he could draw such a conclusion, given that there were no leads or probes connected to Wood's head.\n\nArizona's execution protocol calls for trained medical personnel \u2013 who are not involved with the execution process \u2013 to be available nearby to respond to any medical emergency before the start of the execution, while any decision about whether to continue with the process if it is going awry is up to the director of the state department of corrections.\n\nAfter debating any possible role of the Arizona governor, judge Wake says he is concerned that \"depending on the accuracy of the information Mr Zick has passed on that suspending the execution may do more harm than good\" and that his \"principal focus here is on the chance of pain\" given the US constitution's prohibition of \"cruel and unusual punishment\".\n\nAs discussions continue, Zick tells the judge: \"Wait. I just \u2013 I'm sorry, Judge ... I just learned that the IV team leader has confirmed Mr Wood's death.\"\n\nIt seems unlikely that Wake would have halted the execution in any case. After hearing the news of Wood's death, the judge said he wanted to \"finish my thought\" anyway, saying that in his judgment \"there was not a serious prospect of pain and that terminating the execution did not have prospect of eliminating pain.\"\n\nHowever, he told Konrad: \"I am not finding that there was not pain before. I'm not finding that at all...

It was the third time this year that a lethal injection procedure has gone wrong, following problems in Ohio and Oklahoma. \n\n\n\nWood was put to death using an experimental combination of midazolam and hydromorphone, the same drugs used to kill McGuire in Ohio in January. He took 26 minutes to die, and witnesses said he gasped for air and snorted loudly.\n\nMidazolam, meant to act as a sedative, was also used by Oklahoma in April.

As supplies have run short, and expired, states have resorted to untried improvisations while insisting on hiding the identities of their suppliers in order to keep supply lines open.\n\nBaich said Arizona prison officials told Wood's lawyers that the execution would be carried out using higher dosages than Ohio employed in McGuire's death, but refused to disclose the source of the drugs.\n\n\"We asked for that information. We were stonewalled, we went to court, and a federal appeals court ordered the department of corrections to turn that information over to us [but] the US supreme court vacated that order,\" Baich said.\n\nWood, 55, was pronounced dead at 3.49pm local time, one hour and 57 minutes after the start of the procedure. \"The courts have ordered that all evidence be preserved including blood and tissue samples as well as labels and any residual drugs that remain,\" Baich said.\n\nJan Brewer, the Arizona governor, said she was concerned by the length of the execution and ordered Arizona prison officials to conduct a review, but insisted the execution was lawful. \n\n\n\nShe said in a statement: \"I am concerned by the length of time it took for the administered drug protocol to complete the lawful execution of the convicted double murderer, Joseph Wood.

Robin Konrad, one of Wood's legal team, attempted to convince Neil Wake, an Arizona district judge, to halt the execution and order prison officials to start lifesaving techniques.\n\n\"Mr Wood's execution started at 1.52. He was being sedated at 1.57. Since that time he has been gasping, snorting, and unable to breathe and not dying. And we're asking \u2013 our motion asks for you to issue an emergency stay and order the Department of Corrections to start lifesaving techniques as required under their protocol,\" Konrad told the judge.\n\nJeffrey Zick of the Arizona attorney general's office was on the call and tried to assure the judge that Wood was unconscious: \"The individual who does the consciousness check determined, medically determined that Mr Wood was unconscious; that his mouth was open; that at some point during the \u2013 when the drugs were given, an involuntary reaction or a snoring-type reaction was taking place; that it had been ongoing. A second consciousness check was given. He is unconscious.\"\n\nHowever, when Zick claimed he was told that Wood \"is effectively brain dead ... the brain stem is working but there is no brain activity\", the judge questioned how he could draw such a conclusion, given that there were no leads or probes connected to Wood's head.\n\nArizona's execution protocol calls for trained medical personnel \u2013 who are not involved with the execution process \u2013 to be available nearby to respond to any medical emergency before the start of the execution, while any decision about whether to continue with the process if it is going awry is up to the director of the state department of corrections.\n\nAfter debating any possible role of the Arizona governor, judge Wake says he is concerned that \"depending on the accuracy of the information Mr Zick has passed on that suspending the execution may do more harm than good\" and that his \"principal focus here is on the chance of pain\" given the US constitution's prohibition of \"cruel and unusual punishment\".\n\nAs discussions continue, Zick tells the judge: \"Wait. I just \u2013 I'm sorry, Judge ... I just learned that the IV team leader has confirmed Mr Wood's death.\"\n\nIt seems unlikely that Wake would have halted the execution in any case. After hearing the news of Wood's death, the judge said he wanted to \"finish my thought\" anyway, saying that in his judgment \"there was not a serious prospect of pain and that terminating the execution did not have prospect of eliminating pain.\"\n\nKonrad questions any assertion that Wood was definitively not suffering during the execution. \"It is premature to make that statement without having the necessary information,\" she told the Guardian. \"We do not know anything about the drugs, we do not know the qualifications of the medical team who were making these determinations.\n\n\n\n\"There was no medical equipment hooked up in order to make a determination that he was brain-dead ...

But yet again, experts said it was unlikely that the episode would lead to widespread changes or prompt states to seriously alter their policies.\n\nThe execution of Joseph R. Wood III, who was killed by lethal injection Wednesday in Arizona, took nearly two hours. Witnesses reported that Wood was gasping and struggling to breathe, although state officials and other witnesses argued that he was only snoring. But the amount of time it took Wood to die, which lasted for so long that his attorneys were able to file requests asking for a stay while the execution was ongoing, prompted Gov. Jan Brewer (R) to order a review.\n\n\"Any time there's a significant event like this one, it carries some weight,\" said Deborah W. Denno, a Fordham University professor and expert on the death penalty.\n\nIn particular, she said, Wood's prolonged death could increase scrutiny of how states use the sedative midazolam in executions. That drug was used, along with hydromorphone, during the execution at the Arizona State Prison Complex an hour outside of Phoenix. Wood's attorneys had argued that more information was needed about these two drugs, which were combined for the first time in an execution in Arizona.\n\nThe state altered its lethal injection protocols to use these two drugs because the ongoing shortage of lethal injection drugs left it unable to find pentobarbital.\n\n\"Neither of these drugs are designed to kill,\" said Joel Zivot, an assistant professor of anesthesiology at the Emory University School of Medicine. \"Companies create and sell phamaceuticals where their purpose is to heal. The state takes these pharmaceuticals and tries to imagine a different purpose for them, and to see if they can turn these medicines into poisons.\"\n\nMidazolam also factored into two other episodes this year that provoked concern. In Ohio, witnesses said Dennis McGuire repeatedly gasped during his January execution, which lasted for almost half an hour.\n\nAnd a botched execution in Oklahoma drew worldwide attention in April, with witnesses reporting that Clayton Lockett was grimacing and clenching his teeth before the execution was called off. Lockett died a short time later, and an independent autopsy pointed to problems with the IV placement, rather than the drugs used.\n\nThe drawn-out execution in Arizona renewed calls for the United States to do away with capital punishment.\n\n\"Capital punishment is cruel, inhuman and degrading, and the distressing case of Joseph R. Wood III's potentially botched execution in Arizona is only the latest example of why this abhorrent practice must be abolished in the United States,\" Steven W. Hawkins, executive director of Amnesty International USA, said in a statement.\n\nBut officials in states that conduct the most executions said they did not plan to change how they carry out the death penalty. Missouri said it is still prepared to hold its seventh execution of the year on Aug. 6 using the same drug protocol \u2014 an injection of pentobarbital \u2014 it has used since last year. That would tie it with Florida and Texas for the most executions so far this year.\n\nThe Texas Department of Criminal Justice said that it would continue to use a single dose of pentobarbital, spokesman Robert C. Hurst said in a statement. \"The agency has used this protocol since 2012 and has carried out 33 executions without complication,\" he said. \u200b\n\nA spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Corrections said that the state is always evaluating its policies but declined to comment further because there is a pending lawsuit against Ohio by McGuire's family.\n\nOn Thursday, Dale Baich, an attorney for Wood, called for an independent investigation into the execution. While Brewer has ordered the state Department of Corrections to conduct a review, Baich argued that an outside inquiry is needed to find out much more about the drugs that were used \"following an execution cloaked in secrecy that went wrong.\"\n\nWood's attorneys had filed a request for an emergency stay of execution an hour into the procedure, saying that Wood remained alive and was gasping. They also filed a stay request with Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who is the justice assigned to hear emergency requests from the West. Supreme Court personnel said it was extremely rare for a justice to receive a request to stop an execution already underway and were unable to recall a similar instance.\n\nWood's attorneys filed the stay request with the Supreme Court at 6:27 p.m. Eastern time. The clerk's office informed the lawyers at 6:46 p.m. that Kennedy had denied the stay, three minutes before Wood was pronounced dead.\n\nExecutions are, by nature, carried out far from public view, witnessed by a handful of individuals in small rooms inside prison complexes. Many occur without much notice. It often takes a gruesome episode to capture public attention.\n\nThe prevalence of the death penalty, meantime, is in decline. A third of the 18 states to abolish the practice have done so since 2007. The number of executions has also dropped, with the average number of executions falling significantly after a surge in executions in about 2000.\n\n\"The death penalty has become less relevant,\" Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, said in an interview after the Ohio episode. \"For most of the country, it's just not used enough to be a regular part of the criminal justice system.\"\n\nMeanwhile, even as a majority of Americans still support the death penalty, the percentage of Americans in favor of it dropped from 78 percent in 1996 to 55 percent last year, the Pew Research Center reported.\n\n\"I like to say that support for the death penalty is wide but shallow,\" said Douglas A.

Wood III's potentially botched execution in Arizona is only the latest example of why this abhorrent practice must be abolished in the United States,\" Steven W. Hawkins, executive director of Amnesty International USA, said in a statement.\n\nCassandra Stubbs, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Capital Punishment Project, said the \"horrifying and shocking\" execution provided yet another example of how the death penalty is broken.\n\n\"The real question is, have we hit the tipping point?\" Stubbs said. \"I'm hopeful that we're going to see movement...that there will be states that say we need to put this process on hold.\"\n\nBut officials in states that carry out the most executions said they did not plan to change anything after the episode in Arizona.

Kennedy. The clerk's office informed his lawyers at 6:46 that Kennedy had denied the stay, three minutes before Wood was pronounced dead.\n\nSince ruling in 2008 that lethal injections did not violate the Constitution's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment, the justices have been reluctant to second-guess state procedures. But after problems with executions in several states this year, lawyers for death row inmates renewed their efforts.\n\nThe court turned down a stay request from a Missouri inmate facing imminent execution to learn where the drugs that were to be used on him came from. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, said she would have stopped the execution in order to consider the large question raised by the inmate, but it takes the votes of four justices to accept a case.\n\nOn Tuesday, the court dismissed a federal appeals court's stay of execution for Wood. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit had agreed to halt the execution until Arizona told Wood more about the drugs that would be used.\n\nIn a notable dissent, the circuit's chief judge, Alex Kozinski, argued that lethal injection was a fundamentally flawed concept.\n\n\"Using drugs meant for individuals with medical needs to carry out executions is a misguided effort to mask the brutality of executions by making them look serene and peaceful\u2014like something any one of us might experience in our final moments,\" he wrote.\n\n\"But executions are, in fact, nothing like that. They are brutal, savage events, and nothing the state tries to do can mask that reality. Nor should it. If we as a society want to carry out executions, we should be willing to face the fact that the state is committing a horrendous brutality on our behalf.\"\n\nKozinski argued that the country should return to methods like gas chambers, the electric chair or firing squads. Several states have contemplated such options in recent months, spurred on by the drug shortage, though most of these ideas have simply been floated rather than enacted.\n\nTennessee was one exception, changing its laws in May to make the electric chair the default method of execution if lethal injection drugs were not available.\n\nIt's unlikely that movements to switch to the firing squads or other methods will take on much momentum because of the \"perceived brutality,\" said Douglas A. Berman (no relation), a professor at Ohio State University and a sentencing and death penalty expert.\n\nSome states may consider other options, but it will only become serious when they make another method of execution \"the primary method of execution,\" he said.\n\nExecutions are, by nature, hidden away from the majority of the public, witnessed by a handful of souls sitting in small rooms inside prison complexes. Many occur without much notice at all, and even unusual events \u2014 like three executions carried out in under 24 hours, a flurry of lethal activity that unfolded last month in Georgia, Missouri and Florida \u2014 usually draw little public notice. It takes a particular gruesome account or jarring detail for situations like those in Arizona, Oklahoma and Ohio to puncture the veil of sameness and capture public attention.\n\nPart of that stems from the fact that the death penalty as a whole appears to be fading, both in usage and popularity. A third of the 18 states to officially abolish the practice have done so since 2007. The number of executions has also declined, with the average number of executions dropping significantly after a surge in executions around the turn of the century.\n\n\"The death penalty has become less relevant,\" Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, said in an interview after the Ohio episode. \"For most of the country, it's just not used enough to be a regular part of the criminal justice system.\"\n\nMeanwhile, even as a majority of Americans still support the death penalty, the percentage of Americans in favor of it dropped from 78 percent in 1996 to 55 percent last year, the Pew Research Center reported.\n\n\"I like to say that support for the death penalty is wide but shallow,\" Berman said. \"By that I mean, people are comfortable with the death penalty when it seems to be functioning well.\"\n\nPeople seem to want there to be this ultimate punishment while simultaneously looking to avoid any brutality, he said.\n\n\"There's a kind of...dichotomy or cognitive dissonance to trying to make both of those things operate,\" he said. \"It's based in a residual humanity that we retain even as we want to condemn the most brutal of crimes.\"", "html": null, "created_at": 1406258474.0, "image": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_908w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2014-07-24/AP/Arizona_Execution_Account-07c25.jpg&w=480", "title": "Another execution gone awry.

During that time, investigators methodically detained and investigated a series of party underlings and oil executives whose careers were linked to Zhou.\n\nEven before the investigation was made official Tuesday, existing signs of such a probe had sent tremors throughout China's often factional and cut-throat political circles.\n\nThe announcement Tuesday was made by state-controlled Xinhua News Agency in a terse statement offering little additional detail except that Zhou was suspected of a \"serious disciplinary violation.\"\n\nIf expelled from the party and prosecuted for corruption, Zhou would be the highest-ranking party leader to be taken down in decades. By targeting Zhou, Xi is breaking an unwritten party rule against going after current or former Standing Committee members, the party's most inner circle of leaders.\n\nBut as targets go, the famously stone-faced Zhou is a particularly palatable one for the Chinese public.\n\nZhou built China's domestic security system into a feared, sprawling apparatus \u2014 as head of the Ministry of Public Security, then as the highest overseer of its police, courts, prosecutorial system and intelligence work.\n\nDuring Zhou's tenure, China's spending on domestic security exceeded even its defense budget.\n\nIn a sign of the growing discomfort with the power Zhou had amassed, his successor as security czar was not given a seat on the ruling Standing Committee when Xi and a new generation of top leaders were introduced last year.\n\nThe party's purge and sensational trial of former high-ranking party leader Bo Xilai was also seen as a knock against Zhou, who had been a longtime patron of Bo.\n\nSince Bo's downfall more than a year ago, rumors have circulated that Zhou might be purged, even as several officials close to Zhou were investigated and arrested.\n\nMany of the first officials targeted were linked to Zhou's earlier career in China's lucrative state-owned oil sector, which has come to be associated with widespread corruption.\n\nThose investigated included the former chairman of China National Petroleum Corp. and the former deputy party secretary in Sichuan, where Zhou once served as party chief.\n\nSeveral overseas Web sites have said that Zhou's son Zhou Bin has been placed under investigation and detention \u2014 a fact that would give Xi and other leaders significant leverage as they try to gather evidence and force a confession from Zhou of his crimes. But Chinese authorities have remained silent on Zhou's son.\n\nOne key decision Xi needs to make is whether to move against Zhou with only allegations of monetary corruption or to include political ones as well, such as attempts at a power coup, analysts say.

Within this system, the fallen security tsar Zhou Yongkang \u2013 China's third most powerful man until he retired in 2012 \u2013 was a rare anomaly. The further he receded from view, the more attention he commanded.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Communist party put an end to months of speculation when it announced an inquiry into Zhou, 71, \"for grave violations of discipline\", shorthand for corruption. He is the highest-level figure in the party's history to be investigated for graft. But for years prior, profiles of Zhou painted him as China's Dick Cheney, his immense power matching only his moral decay. He certainly looks the part: while China's president, Xi Jinping, carries a perennial expression of enlightened bemusement, Zhou's steely visage suggests barely concealed malice; his occasional smiles look painful and forced.\n\nDuring Zhou's last five years in power, he was the head of the Communist party's political and legislative affairs committee, in charge of its state security, courts, police and paramilitary. He was known for his frequent use of the term \"hostile forces\" \u2013 an intentionally vague category encompassing a multitude of disparate camps, from pro-democracy campaigners to activists in Tibet. He worked tirelessly to contain them, maintaining a vast \"stability maintenance\" apparatus involving draconian internet censorship campaigns and extralegal penal systems. Zhou's only superiors were the president and the prime minister, and during his tenure China's domestic security budget exceeded that of its military.\n\nReuters and the New York Times first reported that Zhou was under formal investigation in late 2013, but party disciplinary authorities had been tightening the net for months. They detained a large cohort of his one-time aides and proteges, including a former vice-governor of Sichuan province, a state-owned enterprise regulator and a handful of senior officials at China National Petroleum Corporation. They also went after his family members, many of whom had apparently leveraged Zhou's influence to amass extraordinary wealth. Those held included his brother Zhou Yuanqing; his second wife, Jia Xiaoye; his 41-year-old son, Zhou Bin; and various in-laws.\n\nState media remained silent even as Zhou's empire began to crumble, and in the absence of official information, rumours proliferated. They ranged from the carefully deduced to the wildly outrageous. Zhou has been accused of accepting bribes and orchestrating a crippling attack on Google \u2013 both of which seem plausible, if unverifiable \u2013 but also ordering aides to murder his first wife, and even attempting a coup d'\u00e9tat.\n\n\"Zhou turned stability maintenance into an industry,\" said Zhang Lifan, a prominent Communist party historian in Beijing. Zhang spent years under surveillance after urging the central government to follow its own constitution, which guarantees freedom of speech and assembly. During Zhou's reign, Zhang said, his overseers were unbearably invasive. State security tailed his car and froze his bank accounts. \"Monitoring a person to this degree, it's really hard to take,\" he said. Only a few days after Zhou retired in 2012, he said, the surveillance eased.\n\nZhou was born in 1942 in Wuxi, a sprawling metropolis in coastal Jiangsu province. His father, Zhou Yisheng, sold eels from a local creek, and his mother raised silkworms. He graduated from the Beijing Petroleum Institute in 1966, the first year of the Cultural Revolution, and over the next three decades climbed the ranks in China's state-controlled oil sector. By 1996 he was the general manager of the China National Petroleum Corporation, the country's largest energy company.\n\nTwo years later, he made a remarkable \u2013 and poorly understood \u2013 transition into mainstream politics, cycling through a brief stint as head of the land and resources ministry before becoming the Communist party head of Sichuan province. He was named minister of public security in 2003.\n\nAnalysts say Zhou may be the first person in Communist party history to have entered its highest ranks through the security forces. \"He seems to be a terrible crook, if the rumours are true,\" said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, an expert on elite Chinese politics at Hong Kong Baptist University. \"Why was he transferred from the oil business to public security? There is no relationship between the two. So he must have been protected, or given something to [the former president] Jiang Zemin and his people for the promotion.\"\n\nZhou was considered a patron of the disgraced Chongqing party boss Bo Xilai, a one-time presidential hopeful who is serving a life sentence for corruption, embezzlement and abuse of power. Political analysts once agreed that Bo would probably succeed Zhou on the elite politburo standing committee. Then in 2012 Bo's wife murdered a British businessman in a Chongqing hotel, triggering an investigation, his arrest and ultimately his conviction. According to the New York Times, Bo said at his trial that an organisation run by Zhou \u2013 the central politics and law commission \u2013 ordered him to keep the murder secret.\n\nAnalysts say President Xi considered Bo a threat. With Bo out of the picture, Xi could launch an attack on Zhou. And by attacking Zhou, Xi could further consolidate his grip on power, battling entrenched interests across the oil industry and domestic security apparatus and paving the way for economic reform.\n\nLast October, Zhou visited the China University of Petroleum's 60th anniversary celebration. In pictures posted on the university's website, Zhou stands tall, sporting a black suit and his trademark grin. Students bow towards him deferentially. It was the last time he was seen in public.\n\nOn Tuesday, shortly after Xinhua, China's official newswire, announced the investigation into Zhou in three short lines, many Chinese media outlets re-ran the photos. There was little else for them to publish.", "html": null, "created_at": 1406660760.0, "image": "http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/29/1406646021279/Zhou-Yongkang-011.jpg", "title": "Zhou Yongkang: oil boss who became China's third most powerful man", "feed_id": 18, "updated_at": 1418344755.045633, "source_id": 7, "url": "http://feeds.theguardian.com/c/34708/f/663879/s/3cfadfc6/sc/2/l/0L0Stheguardian0N0Cworld0C20A140Cjul0C290Czhou0Eyongkang0Echina0Eprofile/story01.htm", "id": 7518}, {"text": "For 10 months, the fate of Zhou Yongkang existed in a space of plausible deniability. Respected Western media outlets had reported that the 71-year-old Zhou, a retired official who served as China's much-feared domestic security czar from 2007 to 2012, was being investigated for corruption and had been placed under house arrest. Chinese state media published long exposes on the alleged corrupt practices of his son Zhou Bin, and on his many associates and proteges. But they never once uttered his name.\n\nSometimes they obliquely called him \"The Tiger,\" in reference to Chinese President Xi Jinping's oft-quoted mantra of his anti-corruption campaign: fight both flies (low-ranking officials) and tigers (the bosses). Sometimes they called him Zhou Yuangen, his original name, or the father of Zhou Bin. And sometimes they called him \"You Understand, Don't You,\" the phrase a government spokesman coyly used to explain why he couldn't say more about Zhou. For Chinese state media writing in Mandarin, his actual name was too serious and terrifying to print -- without confirmation from officialdom that the hammer had fallen on Zhou.\n\nThat taboo was broken on July 29, when China's official news wire Xinhua released a one-sentence statement confirming that Zhou is under investigation for serious discipline violations. (In China, an official announcement of being under investigation is basically tantamount to conviction.) Soon afterward, dozens of Chinese state media outlets published articles about Zhou. And for the first time in Mandarin, they used his name.\n\nChina's fearsome former domestic-security enforcer is now finished. Zhou is now likely under shuanggui: Chinese Communist Party-speak for an internal investigation against its own members -- a process that usually involves lengthy detention and intense interrogation without any due process or legal representation.\n\nZhou's downfall is a big deal. From 2007 to 2012 Zhou was a member of the party's top governing body, the Politburo Standing Committee. Officially, he was the secretary of the Central Politics and Law Commission, which oversees domestic security in China. Comrades with loftier titles than Zhou have been ousted before because of political infighting. Mao Zedong purged Chinese President Liu Shaoqi in 1966. Deng Xiaoping took down Wang Hongwen, who ranked third in the Politburo Standing Committee for part of the 1970s, and placed Party Secretary Zhao Ziyang under house arrest in 1989. But there are no known examples of current or former members of the Standing Committee being investigated for corruption in this manner.\n\nHowever, there are still quite a few precedents for handling Zhou's case. Three men in the 25-member Politburo have been investigated and prosecuted for corruption in the past two decades. If their experiences are anything to go by, Zhou can expect at least a year of internal investigations by the party, followed by a formal prosecution in the judicial system, which could take months to reach a verdict. Chen Xitong was removed from his post as Beijing's party boss in September 1995, and a court convicted him in February 1998. Similarly, Shanghai party boss Chen Liangyu was removed from his post in September 2006 and sentenced -- to 18 years for bribe-taking and abuse of power -- a year and half later, in April 2008.\n\nIn the age of social media, the current generation of Chinese may expect a public trial of Zhou, much like the closely followed August 2013 trial of ex-Chongqing party boss Bo Xilai that was broadcast online via Sina Weibo, China's Twitter. However, Bo might be the exception rather than the rule. Once dubbed China's \"only celebrity politician\" prior to his fall from grace, Bo had long been known as a showman who sought out the limelight and had a solid fan base among left-leaning Chinese. Immediately after the announcement of his investigation in April 2012, rumors on Chinese-language websites indicated that Bo had refused to cooperate with the investigators -- unless he received a public trial.\n\nZhou, on the other hand, does not seem to have the same fondness for the camera. Even in a government known for its opacity, Zhou was a mysterious presence, known for his frown, and his Jack Palance-esque feats of strength: China News Service, a state-run news agency, wrote of a trip he took to a police station in Yunnan in 2007, where the then-65-year-old surprised onlookers by doing \"10 sit-ups in one breath.\"\n\nBut the media flurry since the announcement of his indictment may be intended to humanize Zhou -- to show him as a man with faults, rather than an indistinct symbol of absolute power. Along with long biographies of Zhou and his rise and fall from power that Chinese state media released on July 29, several news outlets also presented detailed and painstakingly curated photo slideshows, which contain a number of previously unreleased and surprisingly candid shots of Zhou. The news portal Sina published 21 photos, including one that may show Zhou targeted in a Mao-era (1949-1976) campaign -- if true, a previously unknown setback to Zhou's career. More impressive is the 62-photo slideshow curated by the news portal ifeng. There is a photo dated October 2010 of Zhou clasping hands with reclusive North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang, looking over a crowd of an estimated 100,000 people. There are several photos of a younger Zhou in the 1980s, smiling generously at his comrades. There are photos of Zhou walking or giving press conferences with the now-disgraced Bo. But none of the photos appear to show any non-disgraced top official. The shots -- common in party pageantry -- of the members of the Standing Committee standing together were absent.\n\nThe cover image shows Zhou with his eyes squeezed shut, his mouth tightened by a frown. But unlike many photos of Zhou's frown, this one presents Zhou as a sympathetic figure, awash in his sorrows.\n\nZhou is no longer \"Tiger,\" or \"You Understand, Don't You,\" or a force only understandable through his relations with others. Now he is just a man. And he lost.", "html": null, "created_at": 1406698025.0, "image": "http://www.foreignpolicy.com/files/imagecache/860x/images/zyk_small.jpg", "title": "Paper Tiger", "feed_id": 46, "updated_at": 1418345538.04813, "source_id": 14, "url": "http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/07/29/zhou_yongkang_fall_china", "id": 7902}, {"text": "It was an exchange perfectly tailored for modern Chinese politics: alternately unscripted and cagey, chummy but laced with a hint of menace. At a Beijing press conference following a Chinese Communist Party meeting in early March, a reporter for Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post had just asked party spokesman Lu Xinhua whether foreign reports about the imminent downfall of Zhou Yongkang -- once the country's feared security chief, Politburo Standing Committee member, and part-time oil baron, whose investigation for corruption was only officially announced July 29 -- were true. Lu gave a nervous laugh.\n\n\"In fact, I'm like you; I'm getting my information from media reports,\" he began, to laughs from the assembled press corps. But Lu soon reverted to form, reading from scripted remarks that 31 high-ranking bureaucrats who had acted \"contrary to law and party discipline\" had already been punished. \"It doesn't matter who you are, how high your position is.\" Violators would be \"punished severely, and this is absolutely not an empty statement.\" That was his entire answer, Lu explained. He concluded with a beseeching gesture, and added, \"you understand.\" The crowd broke into laughter again.\n\nIt was a light moment, but its significance was not lost on anyone in attendance: a central government official had just acknowledged that Zhou was in trouble. It not only gave rise to a new Chinese Internet meme, with \"you understand\" becoming code for the name many then dared not write or speak. It also preceded a slow drip of domestic media coverage that lent credence to earlier foreign reports of Zhou's imminent career demise -- particularly a December 2013, Reuters report that quoted anonymous sources saying Zhou had been placed under house arrest -- and muted, highly coded Chinese social media chatter that touched obliquely on the Reuters report and the rumors surrounding Zhou.\n\nIn early March, just two days after the now-famous presser, China's Tencent news portal published purported flyover video of Zhou's family compound, although the article was focused on brother Zhou Bin. That same month, Beijing News reported that a \"task force\" had arrested Zhou's brother, Zhou Yuanqing, and his wife. And in July, state news service Xinhua reported that Jiang Jiemin, once a high-ranking oil executive connected to Zhou, was under investigation for breaking the law. He had \"fallen from his horse,\" the report read, Chinese slang for a disgraced official. Each subsequent report, high-profile arrest, and public affront to the Zhou family tore yet another chunk from the tattered edges of the security czar's once-formidable web of influence and patronage.\n\nIt's unclear whether the slow procession of reports touching on the man many netizens also took to calling \"Master Kang\" -- a brand of noodles that happens to share part of Zhou's given name -- was part of a grand media strategy. If so, it was a masterstroke, at least from the perspective of a leadership determined to ensure that Chinese media bolster party control. President Xi Jinping had promised in January 2013 to go after both \"tigers and flies,\" meaning officials high and low, who were guilty of corruption. By the time state-news services announced that Zhou was under investigation for \"serious violations of party discipline\" -- with investigation almost certainly leading to charges and eventual conviction -- the fall of tiger Zhou, once a political rival to Xi, was widely seen as a fait accompli. Within hours, Chinese mainstream media had flooded Weibo, China's Twitter, with retrospectives, infographics, and long-form analyses that had obviously been prepared in advance and then held for publication, much the way media outlets treat obituaries for statesmen. Few grassroots comments evinced anything approaching surprise.\n\nThat's not to say Zhou isn't a hot Weibo topic. Over 1.3 million comments mentioning \"Zhou Yongkang\" have proliferated less than 24 hours after the years-long ban on his name was lifted. Particularly popular are close readings of the damning 76-word announcement, a typically terse entry from the party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, an organ that totes a stick large enough to bludgeon the most powerful cadre but speaks softly enough to bring out everyone's inner Kremlinologist. One popular theory -- shared by observers as diverse as state mouthpiece newspaper People's Daily and feisty independent journalist Luo Changping -- is that the press release's failure to call Zhou a \"comrade\" means that his expulsion from the party is inevitable.\n\nThey are correct, of course; even without knowing what charges will be filed against Zhou, it's all but impossible to imagine Zhou keeping his party membership, or even his freedom. That explains why many users are, to quote just one, \"not the least bit shocked\" at the recent revelations. More noteworthy is how the fundamental debate about Zhou's downfall eerily echoes that surrounding one-time rising star Bo Xilai's April 2012 expulsion from party ranks: to wit, whether the culling of a corrupt man (and some of his cronies) is better than nothing, or actually undermines rule of law and trust in the party by allowing the victors in a power struggle to solidify their gains by throwing rivals in the brig.\n\nThe Weiborati appear split on this central question, just as they once were with the far more popular Bo. Many were happy to see Zhou brought down. One wrote that it constituted a \"huge victory,\" even if economist Liu Shengjun fumed that Zhou \"can't avoid responsibility for his role in setting back the rule of law\" during his time in power. Another cheered \"for this country's bright tomorrow,\" because the time had apparently arrived \"to bid goodbye to the era of unbridled power.\" Yet another lauded the president, writing, \"long live boss Xi!\"\n\nOthers felt that that Xi's anti-corruption campaign was mere cover for a political purge, or what one called \"extraordinarily intense [power] games in the background.\" In response to the widespread celebration about Zhou's fate, one user asked, \"Who are you cheering? It's still not supervision by [political] opposition,\" meaning that the party's power, and thus the opportunities for graft it affords, remain essentially unchecked. According to another, the major question isn't whether Zhou is a big tiger, as he surely is, but whether there \"are little tigers who are right now growing up.\" One even advanced the unpopular argument that fallen officials such as Zhou -- who elicits almost no sympathy in Chinese social media, or anywhere else -- are \"tragic figures from head to toe\" because they \"have no legal means to fight back.\"\n\nZhou -- who likely now sits in the dreaded legal limbo reserved only for the party's fallen, known as shuanggui -- probably has few legal options at his current disposal. But cadres in his position years hence may face a different scenario. As many netizens noted, authorities released the news about Zhou almost simultaneously with the announcement of the fourth party plenum in October, one that state broadcaster CCTV claims will \"comprehensively promote the role of law.\" It remains to be seen exactly what that means. It could bring an element of due process into party disciplinary proceedings, which currently operate outside the law. It could require party officials to disclose assets, a request at the top of many citizens' wish lists, but one unlikely to be granted soon. Or it could simply reaffirm the party elite's current approach: using law as one of many tools to bring opponents to heel.", "html": null, "created_at": 1406695666.0, "image": "http://www.foreignpolicy.com/files/imagecache/860x/images/zykpainting_small_thierry_ehrmann_flickr.jpg", "title": "Say It Ain't So, Zhou", "feed_id": 46, "updated_at": 1418345474.08961, "source_id": 14, "url": "http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/07/29/say_it_aint_so_zhou_yongkang_downfall_media_reaction", "id": 7873}], "story_id": 3, "created_at": 1406653800.0}, {"articles": [{"text": "Mr Zhou, 71, is by far the highest-profile figure caught up in President Xi Jinping's crackdown on corruption.

Mr. Zhou, 72, became the first member of the elite Politburo Standing Committee, retired or active, to face criminal investigation in a corruption case. The state news media celebrated the decision as a confirmation that Mr. Xi was serious about cleaning up officialdom.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCorruption is a cancer that has invaded the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s healthy tissue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said an editorial in People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Daily, the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main newspaper, on Saturday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe must use investigating and dealing with Zhou Yongkang\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grave violations to thoroughly advance the struggle against corruption.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe decision by the Communist Party Politburo, a council of 25 senior officials, to expel Mr. Zhou and place him under a legal investigation made it all but certain that he would face trial, conviction and a heavy sentence from one of the party-run courts that were once part of his political fief.\n\nThe Xinhua news agency, which issued the announcement, said the Politburo had made the decision on Friday.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cZhou Yongkang\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions were totally in contravention of the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essence and mission,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the report, citing the Politburo decision. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis has severely damaged the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s image, and brought major damage to the affairs of the party and the people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSeparately, China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top prosecution office, or procuratorate, which handles corruption inquiries, said that Mr. Zhou had been arrested. The office did not provide details of the charges.\n\nUntil now under Mr. Xi, the Communist Party anticorruption agency has investigated dozens of powerful officials, including Xu Caihou, a former People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Liberation Army commander who confessed to taking enormous bribes, according to the official news media. But none of these fallen officials was as formidable as Mr. Zhou.\n\nMr. Zhou stepped down from power in November 2012, at the same congress that appointed Mr. Xi the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leader. For five years starting in 2007, Mr. Zhou held a seat on the Politburo Standing Committee, the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top decision-making body, and at the same time he ran a committee overseeing the police and domestic security forces, as well as courts, prosecutors and prisons.\n\nSoon after Mr. Zhou\u00e2\u0080\u0099s retirement, Mr. Xi and his allies started corruption investigations that targeted Mr. Zhou\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bases of power, especially Sichuan Province, in the southwest, and the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest oil and gas conglomerate, the China National Petroleum Corporation, where Mr. Zhou had risen to become a general manager.\n\nState news outlets have said the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investigation of Mr. Zhou, which was announced in July, showed Mr. Xi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s determination to eradicate graft that had taken deep root in the government over previous decades.\n\nBut the charges now revealed against Mr. Zhou also appear likely to alarm people, because they indicate that China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s police and other domestic security agencies had been controlled by a deeply corrupt politician.\n\nThe investigators found that Mr. Zhou \u00e2\u0080\u009cexploited his position to obtain unlawful gains for multiple people, and directly or indirectly through his family took massive bribes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Xinhua report said.\n\nIn addition, the report said, Mr. Zhou \u00e2\u0080\u009cexploited his powers to help relatives, mistresses and friends make massive earnings through their business activities, creating massive losses for state-owned assets.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Zhou also disclosed party and state secrets and traded favors and money for sex with multiple women, the report said. Party investigators examine a broader range of misdeeds than do crime investigators, and allegations of mistresses and paid sex are not usually prosecuted.\n\nThe announcement did not reveal further details behind the charges against Mr. Zhou. But the accusations that he exploited power to enrich family members and friends appeared to refer to Mr. Zhou\u00e2\u0080\u0099s longstanding influence in the energy sector, especially oil and gas, where he first rose up the party ranks.\n\nAn investigation by The New York Times documented that Mr. Zhou\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son, a sister-in-law and his son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother-in-law held assets worth about 1 billion renminbi, or $160 million, much of it in the oil and gas industries.\n\nLast month, the website of People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Daily published a commentary on the emerging allegations against Mr. Zhou, which described him as the ringmaster of five corrupt circles: Sichuan Province, the oil sector, the public security service, Mr. Zhou\u00e2\u0080\u0099s secretaries, and his family and relatives. Mr. Zhou formed a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccommonwealth of crime,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the commentary.\n\nIn China, criminal investigations of officials on corruption charges usually only start after party investigators have finished their inquiry. Mr. Zhou is now exceedingly unlikely to escape trial, conviction and a heavy prison sentence.\n\nHuman rights advocates and lawyers have said that Mr. Zhou bore major responsibility for reversing modest gains that China had made in giving citizens firmer legal protections. He became identified with a drive over the past decade to place courts, prosecutors and the police under firm party control, in the name of \u00e2\u0080\u009cstability maintenance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe party charges against Mr. Zhou did not mention those decisions and the abuses that they bred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe lawyers all believe that he took rule of law in China backwards at least a decade,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Li Xiaolin, a lawyer who has represented officials tried on corruption charges, said in an interview before the announcement about Mr. Zhou. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s become a victim of the lack of rule of law, because his case is also being dealt with by the legal system that he himself built with his own hands.\u00e2\u0080\u009d", "html": "<html><body><div><div id=\"story-body\" class=\"story-body\">\n\n        \n        \n        <div class=\"lede-container\">\n            <figure id=\"media-100000003273192\" class=\"media photo lede layout-large-horizontal\" data-media-action=\"modal\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope=\"\" itemid=\"http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/06/world/06china/06china-master675.jpg\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\" aria-label=\"media\" role=\"group\">\n    <span class=\"visually-hidden\">Photo</span>\n    <div class=\"image\">\n            <img src=\"http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/06/world/06china/06china-master675.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"media-viewer-candidate\" data-mediaviewer-src=\"http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/06/world/06china/06china-superJumbo.jpg\" data-mediaviewer-caption=\"Zhou Yongkang before relinquishing power in 2012.

Mr. Zhou, 72, became the first member of the elite Politburo Standing Committee, retired or active, to face criminal investigation in a corruption case. The state news media celebrated the decision as a confirmation that Mr. Xi was serious about cleaning up officialdom.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCorruption is a cancer that has invaded the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s healthy tissue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said an editorial in People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Daily, the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main newspaper, on Saturday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe must use investigating and dealing with Zhou Yongkang\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grave violations to thoroughly advance the struggle against corruption.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe decision by the Communist Party Politburo, a council of 25 senior officials, to expel Mr. Zhou and place him under a legal investigation made it all but certain that he would face trial, conviction and a heavy sentence from one of the party-run courts that were once part of his political fief.\n\nThe Xinhua news agency, which issued the announcement, said the Politburo had made the decision on Friday.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cZhou Yongkang\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions were totally in contravention of the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essence and mission,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the report, citing the Politburo decision. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis has severely damaged the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s image, and brought major damage to the affairs of the party and the people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSeparately, China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top prosecution office, or procuratorate, which handles corruption inquiries, said that Mr. Zhou had been arrested. The office did not provide details of the charges.\n\nUntil now under Mr. Xi, the Communist Party anticorruption agency has investigated dozens of powerful officials, including Xu Caihou, a former People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Liberation Army commander who confessed to taking enormous bribes, according to the official news media. But none of these fallen officials was as formidable as Mr. Zhou.\n\nMr. Zhou stepped down from power in November 2012, at the same congress that appointed Mr. Xi the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leader. For five years starting in 2007, Mr. Zhou held a seat on the Politburo Standing Committee, the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top decision-making body, and at the same time he ran a committee overseeing the police and domestic security forces, as well as courts, prosecutors and prisons.\n\nSoon after Mr. Zhou\u00e2\u0080\u0099s retirement, Mr. Xi and his allies started corruption investigations that targeted Mr. Zhou\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bases of power, especially Sichuan Province, in the southwest, and the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest oil and gas conglomerate, the China National Petroleum Corporation, where Mr. Zhou had risen to become a general manager.\n\nState news outlets have said the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investigation of Mr. Zhou, which was announced in July, showed Mr. Xi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s determination to eradicate graft that had taken deep root in the government over previous decades.\n\nBut the charges now revealed against Mr. Zhou also appear likely to alarm people, because they indicate that China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s police and other domestic security agencies had been controlled by a deeply corrupt politician.\n\nThe investigators found that Mr. Zhou \u00e2\u0080\u009cexploited his position to obtain unlawful gains for multiple people, and directly or indirectly through his family took massive bribes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Xinhua report said.\n\nIn addition, the report said, Mr. Zhou \u00e2\u0080\u009cexploited his powers to help relatives, mistresses and friends make massive earnings through their business activities, creating massive losses for state-owned assets.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Zhou also disclosed party and state secrets and traded favors and money for sex with multiple women, the report said. Party investigators examine a broader range of misdeeds than do crime investigators, and allegations of mistresses and paid sex are not usually prosecuted.\n\nThe announcement did not reveal further details behind the charges against Mr. Zhou. But the accusations that he exploited power to enrich family members and friends appeared to refer to Mr. Zhou\u00e2\u0080\u0099s longstanding influence in the energy sector, especially oil and gas, where he first rose up the party ranks.\n\nAn investigation by The New York Times documented that Mr. Zhou\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son, a sister-in-law and his son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother-in-law held assets worth about 1 billion renminbi, or $160 million, much of it in the oil and gas industries.\n\nLast month, the website of People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Daily published a commentary on the emerging allegations against Mr. Zhou, which described him as the ringmaster of five corrupt circles: Sichuan Province, the oil sector, the public security service, Mr. Zhou\u00e2\u0080\u0099s secretaries, and his family and relatives. Mr. Zhou formed a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccommonwealth of crime,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the commentary.\n\nIn China, criminal investigations of officials on corruption charges usually only start after party investigators have finished their inquiry.

However, he said no hypothesis had been excluded.\n\nAn arrival information screen shows the delayed Air Algerie flight 5017 (top) at the Houari Boumediene airport near Algiers (AP) \n\nAH5017 lost contact with aviation officials about 50 minutes after take-off from Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso in west Africa.

We have just heard from the news that the plane went missing,\" said Amina Daher, whose sister-in-line Randa was travelling on the plane with her three children, returning to Beirut to celebrate the Muslim religious festival of Eid El-Fitr with her family.\n\nDue to the unknown location of the plane, officials have not yet stated how many casualties there are.\n\nThe plane is operated by Air Algerie and chartered from Spanish airline Swiftair, who said 110 passengers and six members of crew are on board the MD83 aircraft.

The area where the flight is suspected to have crashed is a sparsely inhabited region of scrubland and desert dunes stretching to the foothills of the Adrar des Ifoghas mountains.\n\nAs the Malian government has only a weak presence in the region, the bulk of the operation is in the hands of France and UN peacekeepers.\n\nAH5017 is the third passenger air crash this week, after the downing of a Malaysia Airlines plane in Ukraine and, the crash of a TransAsia Airways off Taiwan during a thunderstorm on Wednesday.\n\nAir Algerie's last major accident was in 2003 when one of its planes crashed shortly after take-off from the southern city of Tamanrasset, killing 102 people.

He spoke Thursday from a crisis center set up in the French Foreign Ministry.\n\nThe plane had been missing for hours before the news was made public. It wasn't immediately clear why airline or government officials didn't make it public earlier.\n\nAir Algerie Flight 5017 was being operated by Spanish airline Swiftair, the company said in a statement. The Spanish pilots' union said the plane belonged to Swiftair.\n\nThe flight path of the plane from Ouagadougou to Algiers wasn't immediately clear. Ouagadougou is in a nearly straight line south of Algiers, passing over Mali where unrest continues in the north.\n\nNorthern Mali fell under control of ethnic Tuareg separatists and then al-Qaida-linked Islamic extremists following a military coup in 2012. A French-led intervention last year scattered the extremists, but the Tuaregs have pushed back against the authority of the Bamako-based government.\n\nA senior French official said it seems unlikely that fighters in Mali had the kind of weaponry that could shoot down a plane.\n\nThe official, not authorized to speak publicly, said on condition of anonymity that they primarily have shoulder-fired weapons \u2014 not enough to hit a passenger plane flying at cruising altitude.\n\nSwiftair, a private Spanish airline, said the plane was carrying 110 passengers and six crew, and left Burkina Faso for Algiers at 0117 GMT Thursday (9:17 p.m. EDT Wednesday), but had not arrived at the scheduled time of 0510 GMT (1:10 a.m. EDT Thursday).\n\n\"In keeping with procedures, Air Algerie has launched its emergency plan,\" APS quoted the airline as saying.\n\nThe MD-83 is part of a series of long-range jets built since the early 1980s by McDonnell Douglas, a U.S. plane maker now owned by Boeing Co.", "html": null, "created_at": 1406275408.94, "image": "http://www.csmonitor.com/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/content/2014/0724-algeria/18765890-1-eng-US/0724-algeria.jpg", "title": "Air Algerie flight crashed in N.

It had reportedly asked to divert from its planned course because of heavy rain and poor visibility over northern Mali.\n\nEarly on Friday authorities in Mali and Burkina Faso said wreckage had been found on Malian territory scattered and burned, with no survivors. The office of the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, later made the same announcement, saying the plane's wreckage had been positively identified.\n\nMalian state television said the plane crashed between the town of Gossi, about 30 miles (50km) from the Burkina Faso border. Reports of the discovery were repeated by government officials in both countries and by Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, the president of Mali.\n\nThere had been reports of massive sandstorms in the region before the plane disappeared shortly after changing course. It was not thought to have transmitted any distress signal.\n\nOfficials in Burkina Faso, Algeria and France said no hypotheses were being ruled out, including a terrorist bombing or hijack, but seriously doubted that the Islamist forces and militias in northern Mali possessed surface-to-air missiles powerful enough to shoot down the plane.\n\nAlmost half the passengers on board, 51 people, were reported to be French.\n\nThe three airliner crashes in the last week have claimed nearly 450 lives.

Tension between various armed groups and militia, including Islamic extremists and Tuaregs, is high in the area. Its capital, Gao city, is on the river Niger about 190 miles south-east of Timbuktu.\n\nThe French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, summoned key ministers to a crisis meeting at the Elys\u00e9e Palace late on Thursday afternoon, postponing a planned visit to France's Indian Ocean territories.

We are in a series [of crashes] but there is no series because every situation is different ... we have to establish what happened.\"\n\nLaurent Fabius, the foreign minister, said the aircraft had \"probably crashed\".\n\n\"The search is concentrated on a vast part of Malian territory around Gao. Our forces in the region, including medical units, have been mobilised.\"\n\nHe said that if the crash were confirmed it would be \"a major tragedy that has hit our whole nation and others\".\n\nThe plane, a McDonnell Douglas 83, had taken off from the Burkina Faso capital of Ouagadougou and was supposed to take a direct route to Algiers.\n\nAir traffic controllers lost contact with the aircraft, owned by the Spanish company Swiftair, at 0117 GMT, but its disappearance was not made public until several hours after its 0410 GMT scheduled arrival time in the Algerian capital.\n\nOn Thursday evening, hours after the plane's disappearance, the exact identity of the passengers was still shrouded in confusion.

The six crew members \u2013 two pilots and four stewards \u2013 were all Spanish.

(Reuters)\n\nIsrael's military offensive in Gaza entered its third week as the U.S stepped up efforts to help bring about a cease-fire. (Reuters)\n\nA missing Israeli soldier and the cancellation of international flights to and from Israel on Tuesday could bolster Hamas, potentially shifting the dynamics of diplomatic efforts to bring about a cease-fire in the two-week-old Gaza Strip conflict.\n\nIf Hamas is holding the 21-year-old soldier, whom Israel on Tuesday identified as Sgt. Oron Shaul, or his remains, it could give the Palestinian militant group leverage for its political demands \u2014 or it could incite Israel to push deeper into the coastal enclave.\n\nAnd the suspension of flights by all American and some major European carriers reflected the group's ability to affect Israel's economy with its rockets, one of which struck within a mile of the international airport near Tel Aviv on Tuesday, prompting the Federal Aviation Administration's flight ban.\n\nBy Tuesday night, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had phoned U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry to appeal for a resumption of U.S. flights to Israel, underscoring fears here that the country might be labeled a war zone and suffer damage to its tourism, high-tech and investment sectors. A U.S. State Department statement said the ban was meant only to protect American citizens, in an apparent effort to prevent the measure from being seen as U.S. pressure on Israel to agree to Hamas demands.\n\nBut despite a diplomatic push by Kerry and other world leaders, there was no trace of progress Tuesday toward reviving an Egyptian truce proposal rejected by Hamas a week ago or amending it to make it more attractive to Hamas, as the United States is quietly urging. Israel accepted the proposal, but Hamas said it met none of the group's demands.\n\nThose demands, Hamas leaders conveyed to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on Tuesday in Doha, Qatar, include the end of Israel's naval blockade of Gaza and the release of several hundred Hamas prisoners.\n\n\"We are continuing to work, and there is more work to be done,\" Kerry said after meetings at Egypt's presidential palace.\n\nBy Tuesday night, the Palestinian death toll had risen to more than 630 since the conflict erupted July 8, according to officials with the Gaza Health Ministry, with more than half the deaths occurring since Israel launched its ground incursion Thursday night. The United Nations says more than 70 percent of the casualties are civilians, including many children. Israel says it has killed as many as 180 militants.\n\nOvernight, Israel's military announced that two more Israeli soldiers had been killed Monday, bringing the Israeli armed forces' death toll to 27 since Thursday \u2014 the largest number of Israeli troop deaths since the 2006 war with Lebanon. Two Israeli civilians have also been killed by Hamas mortar and rocket attacks into Israel.\n\nThroughout Tuesday, Israel continued to pound Hamas targets in Gaza with airstrikes and from naval vessels off the coast, while Hamas sent a steady barrage of rockets into Israel. One projectile struck a house in Yehud, in central Israel near Ben Gurion International Airport.\n\nThe attack injured one person, but it persuaded the FAA to ban U.S. flights to and from Ben Gurion for 24 hours starting Tuesday afternoon. Airlines including Delta, US Airways, United, Air France and Lufthansa suspended their Israel flights.\n\nIn Gaza, Hamas fighting units are proving to be tenacious, trained and sometimes deadly. According to an Israeli military account released Tuesday, a firefight between members of an elite paratrooper unit and Gaza militants left one paratrooper dead and several wounded. Hamas lost seven fighters in the exchange.\n\nAlso Tuesday, a senior Israeli military official, speaking to journalists in Tel Aviv, suggested that there was a possibility that Shaul, the missing soldier, could have been captured alive by Hamas or another militant faction in Gaza.\n\nShaul was one of seven Israelis inside an aging armored personnel carrier (APC) pushing Sunday into the Shijaiyah enclave of East Gaza, a Hamas stronghold peppered with some of the tunnel networks that Israel says it entered Gaza to destroy. Their vehicle appeared to have a technical malfunction or was somehow prevented from moving forward, the military official said.\n\n\"It was stuck in the middle of the action, and it's possible that some of the guys got out to fix it or tie it up to another APC,\" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in accordance with military procedure.\n\nAs the vehicle stood stuck on the road, he said, Hamas militants struck it with an antitank missile, possibly causing the fuel tank to explode, blowing up and killing all of the soldiers who were inside. It was unclear, the official said, whether Shaul was inside or outside the vehicle when it was hit.\n\nThe bodies of the soldiers were burned beyond recognition, and tests had to be conducted to identify the remains. Six of the seven soldiers were identified, the military said.\n\n\"For the time being, no parts of his [Shaul's] body have been found among the ruins of the APC,\" the senior Israeli military official said.\n\nLater Sunday, a Hamas spokesman said in a televised statement that a soldier named Shaul Aron is \"a prisoner now\" and displayed what he said was Shaul's photo ID and serial number.\n\nIt is not clear that Israel is ready to halt the offensive. Senior Israeli politicians have vowed not leave Gaza until Israel has destroyed all the Hamas tunnels stretching from Gaza into Israel. Hamas has also pledged to continue to fight.\n\nOn Tuesday, addressing reporters, Kerry was deferential to Egypt, stressing that his role is to assist the longtime Arab power broker as it leads the cease-fire efforts. Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry thanked Kerry for the U.S. backing but stressed that the Egyptian proposal had received \"wide support\" on its own.\n\nA senior State Department official, though, later said a truce is not immediately at hand.\n\n\"Right now our focus is on stopping the rocket fire so that we can begin a serious negotiation on the key issues,\" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe Kerry's objectives.\n\nGearan reported from Cairo and Eglash from Tel Aviv.

(AP)\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry traveled to Israel on Wednesday, to push for a cease-fire to end the fighting between Israel and Hamas. (AP)\n\nSecretary of State John F. Kerry claimed some progress Wednesday toward halting the Israeli-Palestinian bloodshed in Gaza, now in its third week, as Israel held a funeral for one of two Americans killed fighting for the Jewish state.\n\n\"We have certainly made some steps forward,\" Kerry told reporters as he began a day of discussions in Israel and the West Bank aimed at a quick end to the fighting. \"There is still work to be done.\"\n\nMore than 650 Palestinians have been killed and 4,000 wounded in Israeli airstrikes and artillery salvos over the last 16 days. There was especially heavy shelling east of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip and in Gaza City on Wednesday morning.\n\nTwenty-nine Israeli soldiers have been reported killed in fighting with Hamas and other Palestinian militant factions. Two Israeli civilians and a Thai guest workers have perished in rocket or mortar attacks launched from Gaza. Wednesday's funeral for U.S. citizen Max Steinberg, 24, from Woodland Hills, Calif., was attended by an estimated 30,000 Israelis.\n\nKerry met first with United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, who has been shuttling among Arab states and Israel seeking an immediate end to violence he has called \"atrocious.\"\n\nBan thanked Kerry for his parallel efforts, but neither diplomat offered any details of their work or an estimate of when the fighting might end.\n\n\"We do not have much time to wait and lose,\" Ban said.\n\nKerry went next to the West Bank headquarters of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who is trying to mediate the crisis on behalf of Hamas. As titular leader of all the Palestinians, Abbas is in a difficult and ever-weaker position the longer the fighting goes on, and the United States hopes to somehow strengthen his hand.\n\nThe United States and Israel consider Hamas a terrorist group, and U.S. officials are barred from direct meetings or negotiations with the militants. Abbas sought to bridge a seven-year schism with the Hamas faction earlier this spring, but the unified government he formed is now blamed by Israel and others for stoking the current crisis.\n\nFollowing his hour-long session in Ramallah, Kerry said there has been \"some progress\" over the past day.\n\nKerry praised Abbas as a leader committed to nonviolence, telling reporters after the meeting that Abbas \"has been working with of all the interested groups and parties and encouraging people to do the responsible thing, which is to come to the table.\"\n\nKerry never mentioned Hamas, which has adherents even in the Fatah-led West Bank, but he made what sounded like a direct appeal to the militants and their supporters.\n\n\"Sometimes it's very satisfying for people to see the immediate impact of the violence,\" Kerry said, \"but it doesn't take you to a solution.\"\n\n\"The people in the Palestinian territories, the people in Israel, are all living under the threat or reality of immediate violence,\" he said. \"This needs to end, for everybody. We need to find a way forward that works, and it's not violence.\"\n\nAt an emergency meeting in Geneva, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said both Hamas and Israel should be investigated for war crimes in connection with attacks on civilian targets.\n\n\"There seems to be a strong possibility that international law has been violated, in a manner that could amount to war crimes,\" she said, citing as an example Israeli airstrikes earlier this week against the al-Aqsa Martyr's Hospital in the Gaza Strip, Britain's Guardian newspaper reported.\n\nShe also said that Hamas was firing rockets indiscriminately from heavily populated areas in Gaza and targeting civilian centers in Israel.\n\nAt Wednesday's funeral for Steinberg, huge crowds gathered at the military cemetery at Mount Herzl in Jerusalem, Israel's version of Arlington National Cemetery, to pay their last respects. Many stood in the blazing sun listening to the prayers, hymns and eulogies. Some of the mourners fainted and were carried away on stretchers by medical personnel.\n\nSteinberg's parents and siblings arrived from the United States, and in their eulogies they described the 5-foot-3 soldier as small in stature but big in heart, a young man who grew up playing soccer, baseball and football. He was a huge Bob Marley fan, and his family and friends read aloud quotes from the reggae superstar's songs to commemorate Steinberg's life.\n\nSteinberg, who grew up in Southern California's San Fernando Valley, was one of thousands of so-called \"lone soldiers\" who have left behind their lives in other nations to fight for the Israel Defense Forces. Trained as a sniper, Steinberg was killed Sunday, along with several of his comrades from Israel's elite Golani Brigade, when Hamas militants ambushed their armored personnel carrier in eastern Gaza's Shijaiyah neighborhood.\n\n\"Do we have any regrets that Max enlisted in the IDF as a lone soldier?\" his father, Stuart Steinberg, told the crowd Wednesday. \"The answer is an unequivocal, 'No.'\"\n\nKerry's arrival in Tel Aviv on a U.S. Air Force plane was not restricted by a Federal Aviation Administration warning against commercial airline travel to the Israel's Ben Gurion International airport.\n\nStunned by the closing of its gateway to the world, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had phoned Kerry to appeal for a resumption of U.S. flights to Israel, underscoring fears here that the country might be labeled a war zone and suffer damage to its tourism, high-tech and investment sectors.\n\nIn light of the FAA warning against flying to Israel's main airport near Tel Aviv, where a Hamas-fired rocket hit a house in a nearby town Tuesday, Transportation Minister Yisrael Katz announced early Wednesday that Israel would open an additional airport in the country's south. Ovda airport was closed as a commercial airport several years ago and sits close to Israel's southernmost town, Eilat, on the Red Sea near the border with Egypt.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether U.S. and European flights would agree to land their jets at Ovda airport.\n\nThe Israel Airports Authority said Tuesday that 80 flights to and from Israel were canceled in light of the FAA decision, leaving thousands of Israelis stranded around the world and thousands more visitors stuck in Israel.\n\nThe suspension of flights by all American and some major European carriers reflected the ability of the militant Palestinian Islamist group to affect Israel's economy with its rockets, one of which struck within a mile of the international airport near Tel Aviv on Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S. State Department sought to calm Israeli anger, explaining in a statement that the ban was meant only to protect American citizens. The statement was an apparent effort to prevent the measure from being seen as U.S. pressure on Israel to agree to Hamas demands.\n\nDespite a diplomatic push by Kerry and other world leaders, there was no trace of progress Tuesday toward reviving an Egyptian truce proposal rejected by Hamas a week ago or amending it to make it more attractive to Hamas, as the United States is quietly urging. Israel accepted the proposal, but Hamas said it met none of the group's demands.\n\nThose demands, conveyed by Hamas leaders to Abbas on Tuesday in Doha, Qatar, include the end of Israel's naval blockade of Gaza and the release of several hundred Hamas prisoners who were rearrested by Israel in a crackdown on Hamas last month in the West Bank after three Israeli teenagers were kidnapped and killed.\n\nIsrael's military announced that two more Israeli soldiers were killed Tuesday, bringing the Israeli armed forces' death toll to 29 since Thursday \u2014 the largest number of Israeli troop deaths since a 2006 war with Lebanon.\n\nThroughout Tuesday, Israel continued to pound Hamas targets in Gaza with airstrikes and from naval vessels off the coast, while Hamas sent a steady barrage of rockets into Israel.

Though Palestinians in Gaza saw it as a victory, they also say it's an indication of the lopsided nature of the conflict.\n\n\"They are killing people without mercy, and this is nothing compared to stopping an airport,\" says Hassan Mazloum, a young man stopped on the street to put oil in his car. \"It's a victory for all the people and the resistance, not just Hamas.\"", "html": null, "created_at": 1406178237.936, "image": "http://www.csmonitor.com/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/content/2014/0723-israel-ben-gurion-airport/18760642-1-eng-US/0723-israel-ben-gurion-airport.png", "title": "With a single rocket, Hamas rattles its enemy (+video)", "feed_id": 10, "updated_at": 1418338758.374851, "source_id": 4, "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2014/0723/With-a-single-rocket-Hamas-rattles-its-enemy-video", "id": 4425}], "story_id": 7, "created_at": 1406164781.865999}, {"articles": [{"text": "As Kerry shuttled in search of a cease-fire, the FAA extended a flight ban to Ben Gurion Airport that Israel sees as a concession to terrorists.

(AP)\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry traveled to Israel on Wednesday, to push for a cease-fire to end the fighting between Israel and Hamas. (AP)\n\nThe United States on Wednesday put the most direct pressure yet on its ally Israel to cut short its military campaign against Hamas in Gaza, but Secretary of State John F. Kerry did not get a deal from Israel or the Palestinians to stop the bloodshed.\n\nDespite a swirl of shuttle diplomacy, the war looked far from over Wednesday. Israeli leaders told their soldiers to prepare for an escalation inside the Gaza Strip, while the leader of Hamas vowed that his Islamist militant movement would not sign a permanent cease-fire until Israel ends its blockade of the coastal enclave.\n\nOrdinary Israelis were upset with the United States and accused the Americans of cowardice after the Federal Aviation Administration, nervous that Hamas rockets have landed near Israel's main airport, extended a ban on U.S. commercial flights to Tel Aviv. The decision was bad news for a small, image-conscious country such as Israel whose economy relies on international trade and tourism.\n\nThe decision to continue to ban flights to and from Israel for a second day came as Kerry met with in Israel with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was angry about the FAA action and suspicious that it was an attempt by the Obama administration to squeeze Israel to end its Gaza campaign.\n\nBut there were signs the fighting will get worse before it ends. While visiting troops preparing to enter the Gaza Strip, Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon signaled that Israel will broaden its air and ground offensive beyond finding and destroying Hamas rockets and tunnels.\n\n\"We are preparing the next stages of the fighting after dealing with the tunnels, and you need to be ready for any mission,\" Yaalon told the soldiers. \"You need to be ready for more important steps in Gaza, and the units that are now on standby need to prepare to go in.\"\n\nThe top Hamas leader, Khaled Meshaal, said his Islamist militant group, which controls the Gaza Strip but is considered a terrorist organization by Israel and the United States, will not sign any lasting cease-fire until Israel lifts its blockade of goods and frees Hamas prisoners.\n\n\"From Day One people told us, agree to a cease-fire and then negotiate on your demands,\" Meshaal said at a news conference in Qatar, where Hamas maintains offices. \"We reject this, and we reject it again tonight.\"\n\nBut Meshaal did signal that a temporary \"humanitarian truce\" could still be possible.\n\nU.S. officials are barred from direct meetings or negotiations with the militants.\n\nTwo senior State Department officials, who described Kerry's discussions on the condition of anonymity, said the goal now is something that stops the fighting and opens the door for additional negotiations. Kerry returned to Cairo on Wednesday night.\n\nThe heavy Israeli bombardment continued Wednesday along a broad front line that stretched the length of the Gaza Strip. In the 16-day conflict, 693 Palestinians have been killed, including 166 children and 67 women, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.\n\nThirty-two Israeli soldiers have been reported killed in fighting with Hamas and other Palestinian militant factions. Two Israeli civilians and a Thai guest worker have perished in rocket or mortar attacks launched from Gaza.\n\nIsrael says that one of its soldiers is still missing and believed dead. Hamas says it has captured the Israeli but has shown images only of his identification card, not a of a body or prisoner.\n\nOn Wednesday, the funeral for an Israeli soldier who is also a U.S. citizen was attended by tens of thousand of mourners at Mount Herzl in Jerusalem, Israel's version of Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nMax Steinberg, 24, who grew up in Los Angeles's San Fernando Valley and adored reggae great Bob Marley, was one of thousands of \"lone soldiers\" who have left their families behind elsewhere in the world to fight for the Israel Defense Forces.\n\nKerry arrived in Tel Aviv early Wednesday aboard a U.S. Air Force jet not bound by the FAA ban on travel to Israel's Ben Gurion International Airport.\n\nThe cessation of flights by U.S. and European carriers was a blow to Israel, which presents itself as a safe and secure place to visit and invest, no matter the chaos, revolution and war that beset its immediate neighbors.\n\nAt an emergency meeting in Geneva, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said both Hamas and Israel should be investigated in connection with attacks on civilian targets.\n\n\"There seems to be a strong possibility that international law has been violated, in a manner that could amount to war crimes,\" she said, citing as an example Israeli airstrikes this week against al-Aqsa Hospital in the Gaza Strip.\n\nShe also said that Hamas was firing rockets from heavily populated areas in Gaza and targeting civilian centers in Israel. Israel says that Hamas employs human shields and is responsible for the deaths of civilians.\n\nThe U.N. human rights commission voted to launch an investigation of Israel. Netanyahu's office blasted the decision as \"a travesty,\" argued that it is Hamas that should be condemned and said the Israeli military \"has gone to unprecedented lengths to keep Palestinian civilians out of harm's way, including by dropping leaflets, making phone calls and sending text messages.\"\n\nKerry claimed unspecified progress toward a goal of ending a conflict that is drawing rising international criticism of Israel, and by extension Washington, Israel's most stalwart ally and defender.\n\n\"We have certainly made some steps forward,\" Kerry said. \"There is still work to be done.\"\n\nThe complex diplomacy will require agreement between Israel and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who is trying to mediate the crisis on behalf of Hamas, after the bitter collapse of U.S.-brokered peace talks in April.\n\nAs leader of all the Palestinians, Abbas is in a difficult position.

At least 15 people were killed and dozens wounded when a U.N.-run school in Gaza sheltering Palestinian evacuees came under shelling on Thursday. (AP)\n\nA U.N.-run school crowded with Palestinian evacuees in the northern part of the Gaza Strip came under shelling on Thursday, leaving at least 15 people dead and more than 100 wounded, Palestinian officials said.\n\nSeveral shells hit the main building and courtyard of the elementary school run by the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in Beit Hanoun, witnesses and Palestinian officials said. They said the school was filled with women and children who had fled their homes to escape more than two weeks of fighting between Israel and Hamas, the militant Palestinian Islamist group that runs the Gaza Strip.\n\nInitial reports indicated that the shells came from Israeli tanks. The Israeli military did not immediately confirm that it was the source of the shelling and said it is looking into the incident.\n\nChristopher Gunness, an UNRWA spokesman, said via Twitter that the agency \"over the course of the day\" had tried to coordinate with the Israeli army a window for civilians to leave, but \"it was never granted.\" He said in another tweet: \"Precise co-ordinates of the UNRWA shelter in Beit Hanoun had been formally given to the Israeli army.\"\n\nIsraeli forces were battling Palestinian militants in Beit Hanoun on Thursday, said Capt. Eytan Buchman, an Israeli army spokesman. He said the militants fired rockets that landed in the city, suggesting that they may have been the ones who hit the U.N.-run facility.\n\n\"But we are very carefully reviewing the incident,\" said Buchman, adding that the Israeli army takes every precaution to not target U.N. sites or civilian structures. The spokesman said the militants \"are using civilian infrastructure and international symbols as human shields.\"\n\nMore than 140,000 Palestinians have fled their homes because of the fighting, and many of them have sought refuge in buildings run by UNWRA.\n\nReporters who arrived at the school soon after the attack found it empty, with pools of blood smeared in the hallways and courtyard. The scene showed evidence of flight and panic. There were sheep running through the corridors, spilled food, abandoned shoes and piles of bloodied bandages.\n\nHundreds of people were taking shelter in the school under U.N. protection when it was struck.\n\nAt the nearby Beit Hanoun Hospital, less than five minutes from the U.N. shelter, terrified children were clinging to their mothers as ambulance drivers surged to the door of the emergency room.\n\nThe hospital director, Ayman Hamdan, said four patients among the first wave of arrivals died on his operating tables. He described massive injuries from shrapnel. Wounded people were missing limbs he said.\n\nSurvivors said they were told to gather at noon to await buses to take them to another UNRWA school that would be safer.\n\n\"We were waiting in the courtyard; the buses never came,\" said Sabah Kafarah, 17, who cradled her infant nephew in her arms. The boy's mother was in surgery.\n\nKafarah and others said they heard at least three explosions.\n\n\"The wounded are women and children, even infants,\" said Hamdan, the hospital director and surgeon. He said his facility was overwhelmed by injured patients, who were being routed to the larger Kamal Adwain Hospital in Beit Lahiya.\n\nA few minutes later after he spoke, a shell exploded 50 yards from the front gate of his hospital, sending a large cloud of dust into the air as journalists, paramedics, patients and their families ducked for cover.\n\nIt was the fourth time that a U.N. facility has been hit since Israel began an operation against Gaza on July 8 aimed at stopping rocket attacks on Israeli soil from the coastal enclave.\n\nThe school was struck amid continuing Israeli airstrikes and as Israeli tanks plowed through Palestinian neighborhoods in Gaza on Thursday with no clear sign of progress in international efforts to broker a truce.\n\nHamas militants stood by their demand that Israel and Egypt lift the economic blockade of the seaside strip that borders both nations before they would lay down their arms. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed resolve that the fighting would go on until Israel accomplishes more of its military goal to destroy Hamas rocket caches and border tunnels used to infiltrate Israel.\n\n\"The terrorists are firing rockets from schools, from mosques, from hospitals, from heavily civilian populations,\" Netanyahu said as he welcomed British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond. \"We have to try and are doing our best to minimize civilian casualties.

(AP)\n\nThe United States on Wednesday put the most direct pressure yet on its ally Israel to cut short its military campaign against Hamas in Gaza, but Secretary of State John F. Kerry did not get a deal from Israel or the Palestinians to stop the bloodshed.\n\nDespite a swirl of shuttle diplomacy, the war looked far from over Wednesday. Israeli leaders told their soldiers to prepare for an escalation inside the Gaza Strip, while the leader of Hamas vowed that his Islamist militant movement would not sign a permanent cease-fire until Israel ends its blockade of the coastal enclave.\n\nOrdinary Israelis were upset with the United States and accused the Americans of cowardice after the Federal Aviation Administration, nervous that Hamas rockets have landed near Israel's main airport, extended a ban on U.S. commercial flights to Tel Aviv. The decision was bad news for a small, image-conscious country such as Israel whose economy relies on international trade and tourism.\n\nThe decision to continue to ban flights to and from Israel for a second day came as Kerry met with in Israel with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was angry about the FAA action and suspicious that it was an attempt by the Obama administration to squeeze Israel to end its Gaza campaign.\n\nBut there were signs the fighting will get worse before it ends.

(AP)\n\nIsraeli forces shelled a U.N.-run school filled with Palestinian refugees in the northern part of the Gaza Strip on Thursday, killing at least 10 people and wounding more than 100, Palestinian officials said.\n\nSeveral shells hit the school run by the U.N. Relief and Works Agency in Beit Hanoun, the Gaza Health Ministry said. Officials said the school was filled with women and children who had fled their homes to escape more than two weeks of fighting between Israel and Hamas, the militant Palestinian Islamist group that runs the Gaza Strip.\n\nAt least four people died on operating tables at the Beit Hanoun hospital, officials said after the shelling, which left hallways at the school slicked with pools of blood.\n\n\"Such a massacre requires more than one hospital to deal with it,\" said Ayman Hamdan, director of the Beit Hanoun hospital, Reuters news agency reported. He said various other medical centers around Beit Hanoun were also receiving wounded people.\n\nMore than 140,000 Palestinians have fled their homes because of the fighting, and many of them have sought refuge in buildings run by UNWRA.\n\nChristopher Gunness, an UNRWA spokesman, said via Twitter that the agency \"over the course of the day\" had tried to coordinate with the Israeli army a window for civilians to leave, but \"it was never granted.\" He said in another tweet: \"Precise co-ordinates of the UNRWA shelter in Beit Hanoun had been formally given to the Israeli army.\"\n\nThe school was struck amid continuing Israeli airstrikes and as Israeli tanks plowed through Palestinian neighborhoods in Gaza on Thursday with no clear sign of progress in international efforts to broker a truce.\n\nHamas militants stood by their demand that Israel and Egypt lift the economic blockade of the seaside strip that borders both nations before they would lay down their arms. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed resolve that the fighting would go on until Israel accomplishes more of its military goal to destroy Hamas rocket caches and border tunnels used to infiltrate Israel.\n\n\"The terrorists are firing rockets from schools, from mosques, from hospitals, from heavily civilian populations,\" Netanyahu said as he welcomed British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond. \"We have to try and are doing our best to minimize civilian casualties. But we cannot give our attackers immunity or impunity.\"\n\nHammond was the latest in a series of international envoys seeking an end to fighting that began July 8 and has killed 32 Israeli soldiers and two civilians, a Thai guest worker and more than 700 Palestinians, most of them civilians.\n\nMilitants have launched more than 2,000 rockets toward Israel in the renewed fighting, which was stoked by the kidnap-murder of three Israeli teenagers and the apparent revenge killing of a Palestinian teen.\n\nNetanyahu did not mention truce efforts in his brief remarks Thursday, which followed the lifting of the U.S. ban on commercial air travel to Israel because of the danger of rocket fire.\n\nSecretary of State John F.

We need to find a way forward that works. And it's not violence.\"\n\nHe also offered \"profound gratitude\" to what he described as 30,000 Israelis who lined Jerusalem streets on Wednesday for the funeral procession of Israeli soldier Max Steinberg, a 24-year-old American from the San Fernando Valley of Southern California who was killed in the fighting. \"That's a remarkable statement \u2014 we're very grateful,\" Kerry said.\n\nKerry later met with Netanyahu for nearly two hours in Tel Aviv, but made no comments and headed immediately back to Cairo.\n\nIsrael launched a massive air campaign on July 8 to stop relentless Hamas rocket fire into Israel and expanded it last week to a ground war aimed at destroying tunnels the military says Hamas has constructed from Gaza into Israel for attacks against Israelis. At least 74 Palestinians were killed on Wednesday and early Thursday, raising the overall death toll in the 16-day war to 702, according to Gaza Health Ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Kidra.\n\nIsrael said five more of its soldiers were killed, bringing the military's death toll to 32. Two Israeli civilians also have died, and a Thai worker in Israel was killed when a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip landed near the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon on Wednesday, police spokeswoman Luba Samri said.\n\nIsrael and the U.S. back an unconditional cease-fire proposal that has been offered by Egypt, which would be followed by talks on a possible new border arrangement for Gaza. Israel and Egypt have severely restricted movement in and out of Gaza since Hamas seized the territory in 2007.\n\nAn Israeli airstrike demolished a home in Gaza's Shijaiyah neighborhood, killing 30-year-old journalist Abdul Rahman Abu Hean, his grandfather and a nephew, according to health officials and relatives.\n\nIsrael also struck the Wafa hospital in Gaza City, which the military says houses a Hamas command center. Basman Ashi, the medical center's director, said all 97 patients and staff were evacuated following Israeli warnings and that no one was hurt in the attack.\n\nAs the Gaza death toll mounted, two Palestinian men were killed in separate clashes with Israeli soldiers near the West Bank City of Bethlehem, doctors said, a potentially ominous development in an area that has so far been relatively quiet.\n\nIsrael has launched more than 3,300 airstrikes since the conflict erupted, while more than 2,250 Palestinian militant rockets have been fired at Israel. The Israeli toll from the rocket strikes has been minimized by the success of the \"Iron Dome\" defense system, but it has not been 100 percent.\n\nFormer New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg landed at Ben-Gurion airport Wednesday night on Israel's national carrier, El Al, and was greeted by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on arrival in a bid to show it is safe to fly to Israel.\n\nGoldenberg reported from Jerusalem.

But Kerry said limited progress has been made.\n\n\"We're doing this for one simple reason: The people in the Palestinian territories, the people in Israel, are all living under the threat or reality of immediate violence,\" Kerry told reporters after a meeting of just over an hour with Abbas in the West Bank town of Ramallah. \"And this needs to end, for everybody. We need to find a way forward that works. And it's not violence.\"\n\nHe also offered \"profound gratitude\" to what he described as 30,000 Israelis who lined Jerusalem streets on Wednesday for the funeral procession of Israeli soldier Max Steinberg, a 24-year-old American from the San Fernando Valley of Southern California who was killed in the fighting. \"That's a remarkable statement \u2014 we're very grateful,\" Kerry said.\n\nKerry later met with Netanyahu for nearly two hours in Tel Aviv, but made no comments and headed immediately back to Cairo.\n\nIsrael launched a massive air campaign on July 8 to stop relentless Hamas rocket fire into Israel and expanded it last week to a ground war aimed at destroying tunnels the military says Hamas has constructed from Gaza into Israel for attacks against Israelis. At least 74 Palestinians were killed on Wednesday and early Thursday, raising the overall death toll in the 16-day war to 702, according to Gaza Health Ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Kidra.\n\nIsrael said five more of its soldiers were killed, bringing the military's death toll to 32. Two Israeli civilians also have died, and a Thai worker in Israel was killed when a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip landed near the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon on Wednesday, police spokeswoman Luba Samri said.\n\nIsrael and the U.S. back an unconditional cease-fire proposal that has been offered by Egypt, which would be followed by talks on a possible new border arrangement for Gaza. Israel and Egypt have severely restricted movement in and out of Gaza since Hamas seized the territory in 2007.\n\nAn Israeli airstrike demolished a home in Gaza's Shijaiyah neighborhood, killing 30-year-old journalist Abdul Rahman Abu Hean, his grandfather and a nephew, according to health officials and relatives.\n\nIsrael also struck the Wafa hospital in Gaza City, which the military says houses a Hamas command center. Basman Ashi, the medical center's director, said all 97 patients and staff were evacuated following Israeli warnings and that no one was hurt in the attack.\n\nAs the Gaza death toll mounted, two Palestinian men were killed in separate clashes with Israeli soldiers near the West Bank City of Bethlehem, doctors said, a potentially ominous development in an area that has so far been relatively quiet.\n\nIsrael has launched more than 3,300 airstrikes since the conflict erupted, while more than 2,250 Palestinian militant rockets have been fired at Israel. The Israeli toll from the rocket strikes has been minimized by the success of the \"Iron Dome\" defense system, but it has not been 100 percent.\n\nFormer New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg landed at Ben-Gurion airport Wednesday night on Israel's national carrier, El Al, and was greeted by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on arrival in a bid to show it is safe to fly to Israel.\n\nGoldenberg reported from Jerusalem.

The second, presented by Hamas and its allies, is that the economic blockade of Gaza, the arrest of hundreds of Hamas members over the past month, and the heavy ordnance that has pounded the tiny enclave is intolerable, and they're responding in self-defense.\n\nBoth sides are right. And both sides are wrong. They are right in that they are pursuing their interests with the tools that they've decided are best suited to the purpose \u00e2\u20ac\" rockets and bombs. And that both sides would like the attacks from the other side to stop.\u00c2\n\nBut they're wrong if they think they're going to achieve their objectives, or if the latest burst of fighting will do anything beyond reinforcing an ugly status quo. The underlying issue is the dying dream of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with no other possible solution on the horizon.\n\nAmi Ayalon, the former head of Israel's Shin Bet security agency, wrote an example of Israel's over-simplified narrative for the New York Times.\n\nWe do not measure ethics and morality by counting dead bodies. The fact that many more Palestinians than Israelis have died does not mean that our cause, or this war, is not just. Many more Germans than Americans died in World War II. Does that mean that Hitler was right and America was wrong? Every state has a duty to defend its citizens. That is what we are doing. The rockets and tunnels targeting Israeli civilians are real threats. But there is a gap between a just war and justice at war, so the question whether our response to the rockets and tunnels is proportionate remains legitimate. The first answer is that we are in compliance with international law. Second, our actions in this war have to be compared with what other states have done or would do when facing similar threats. We give advance notifications to areas we are about to attack. Because of our intelligence capabilities, we give specific warnings to every house we intend to strike, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the attacks -- destroying the launch sites but allowing the militants to escape. How many other states have done this?\n\nWho could argue with a country defending its citizens? But the choice of defense is the mass bombing of Gaza that has claimed over 670 lives so far, most of them civilians. And this feeds anger and despair among the population.\u00c2\n\nMoreover, Mr. Ayalon's comments about warnings to Gaza residents are risible. Many of the survivors of Israeli attacks say they weren't given any warning, didn't have time to evacuate, or didn't have any place to go when Israel declared their neighborhoods as free fire zones. The four boys killed by an Israeli strike last week while\u00c2 playing on the beach in front of the al-Deira Hotel in Gaza City certainly weren't warned.\u00c2\n\nIsrael argues that it has had little choice in the matter. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said about his government's decision to strike Hamas hard in Gaza that \"a man's gotta do what a man's got to do.\" In this narrative, Israel's hands were tied and only had one possible response to the situation.\u00c2\n\nHow did we get here? It depends on who you ask, and where you start. The conflict begins in 1948, with the formation of Israel and the mass-expulsion of Palestinians from towns and cities in what became the Jewish state (the majority of Gaza's residents are descendants of people expelled.) The result is that Palestinians remain stateless to this day.\n\nMore proximately, one could begin in the 1990s, when Israel still occupied the Gaza Strip, and tacitly encouraged the rise of what was to become Hamas in the hopes that it would weaken secular Palestinian liberation groups. This includes the Fatah movement of current Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\nOr one could focus on the failure of both Israelis and Palestinians to make the compromises necessary to fulfill the promise of the Oslo Accords \u00e2\u20ac\" two states for two peoples \u00e2\u20ac\" that were signed in 1995.\n\nWho started the latest hostilities? Israel says Hamas, by choosing to fire rockets and breaking a ceasefire agreed in November 2012. Last year saw the fewest rockets fired from Gaza since 2001, when militants in Gaza first obtained the weapons. Hamas had been enforcing the ceasefire not just on its own members, but on Islamic Jihad and the local militia groups more aligned with Fatah than with the Islamist movement that rules the strip.\n\nFor its part, Hamas says the resumption of rocket fire was in response to Israel's decision to round up hundreds of Hamas members in the West Bank, including over 50 who had been released in 2011 under a prisoner swap with Israel. The mass arrests followed the abduction on June 12 of three Israeli teenagers outside Hebron. In response, Hamas apparently decided that \"a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do\" \u00e2\u20ac\" on June 16 four rockets were fired at Israel from Gaza, and detonated harmlessly.\n\nAs the search for the missing teens went on, six Palestinians were killed by the Israel forces in the West Bank,\u00c2 and about 40 rockets had been fired at Israel in response. On June 30, the bodies of the teens were recovered. Israel then launched 34 attacks on what it called \"terror targets\" in Gaza, and the escalation cycle quickly kicked in. Hamas responded with a statement that if Netanyahu wanted a war, they'd give him one.\n\nAnd here we are, with Palestinian civilians \u00e2\u20ac\" many of whom don't support Hamas \u00e2\u20ac\" once again bearing most of the costs. NBC correspondent Richard Engel said on Tuesday that it's hard to describe Israel's offensive in Gaza as a \"pinpoint\" operation, and cited his visit that day to a family living in an apartment block in Gaza. An Israeli missile attack, purportedly targeting a Hamas member on a lower floor, went through two apartments on higher floors, \"killing the people inside of them to get to the militant two floors down.\"\n\nSome have gone so far as to suggest that it's all the fault of Palestinian voters for electing Hamas. NYU Law Professor Thane Rosenbaum argued in the Wall Street Journal on Monday that folks there are getting what they deserve.\u00c2\n\nThe people of Gaza overwhelmingly elected Hamas, a terrorist outfit dedicated to the destruction of Israel, as their designated representatives. Almost instantly Hamas began stockpiling weapons and using them against a more powerful foe with a solid track record of retaliation.\u00c2 ... On some basic level, you forfeit your right to be called civilians when you freely elect members of a terrorist organization as statesmen, invite them to dinner with blood on their hands and allow them to set up shop in your living room as their base of operations. At that point you begin to look a lot more like conscripted soldiers than innocent civilians. And you have wittingly made yourself targets. It also calls your parenting skills into serious question. In the U.S. if a parent is found to have locked his or her child in a parked car on a summer day with the windows closed, a social worker takes the children away from the demonstrably unfit parent. In Gaza, parents who place their children in the direct line of fire are rewarded with an interview on MSNBC where they can call Israel a genocidal murderer.\n\nHamas did overwhelmingly win the 2006 Palestinian elections. Still, anyone who covered that election and its aftermath knows that the average Palestinian wasn't voting for \"terror.\" Fatah and the PLO had ruled their territories in a corrupt and thuggish manner, and many people turned out for Hamas in the belief that they'd prove more honest and fair in government.\n\nA brief civil war broke out when Fatah refused to recognize the election results, with the US, Israel and Egypt backing Fatah. When the fighting ended, Hamas had Gaza and Fatah had the West Bank. And Israel imposed an economic blockade on Gaza that persists to this day.\n\nDov Weissglass, an adviser to then Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, allegedly said: \"The idea is to put the Palestinians on a diet, but not to make them die of hunger. The hunger pangs are supposed to encourage the Palestinians to force Hamas to change its attitude towards Israel or force Hamas out of government.\"\n\nThe blockade led to the collapse of Gazan industry and mass unemployment. But Israel's collective punishment approach to Palestinian voters has, if anything, led to an entrenchment of Hamas's position in Gaza. There have been no Palestinian elections since, so any voters who regret their choice in 2006 (the evidence suggests there are legions of them) have not had a chance to correct their decision.\n\nMany have argued that Hamas could have simply elected not to respond to Israeli provocation; that firing crude rockets indiscriminately is both a war crime and ultimately ineffective; and they've put the civilian population at risk so they can grandstand. To me, that makes plenty of sense. But to Hamas? They believe they need an offensive capability to prevent Israel from arresting and killing even more of their members, and that capitulation is ultimately more dangerous to their movement than defiance.\n\nTheir ceasefire demands \u00e2\u20ac\" among them, the release of their prisoners and an end to the economic blockade of Gaza \u00e2\u20ac\" are wildly popular among Palestinians, as shown by the support of PA President Abbas. Mr. Abbas is no friend of Hamas, but there's clearly Palestinian consensus on this question.\n\nSo far, 32 Israeli soldiers have died in the fighting with Hamas and two Israeli civilians have been killed by rockets fired at the country. Navi Pillay, the head of the UN's High Commission for Human Rights, says that both sides have likely committed war crimes in the latest conflict.\n\nIs there any morality or \"right\" to any of this? It's hard to see any, and the prospects for a negotiated end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, dim as they were, have only grown dimmer thanks to recent events. That's good for hardliners on both sides, but terrible for peace.", "html": null, "created_at": 1406225013.785, "image": "http://www.csmonitor.com/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/content/2014/0724-gaza/18765541-1-eng-US/0724-gaza.jpg", "title": "Israel, Gaza, morality \u2013 and who started it", "feed_id": 10, "updated_at": 1418339658.86354, "source_id": 4, "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Security-Watch/Backchannels/2014/0724/Israel-Gaza-morality-and-who-started-it", "id": 4796}, {"text": "A black and white approach to the conflict isn't likely to yield better outcomes for either Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nThere are two broad narratives about the current conflict between Hamas and Israel.\n\nThe first, presented by Israel and its allies, is that rocket-fire from the Gaza Strip by Hamas and other militants is an intolerable threat to the country, and that Israel is simply responding in self-defense.

Thane Rosenbaum, a lawyer and director of New York University Law School's Forum on Law, Culture and Society, argued in the Wall Street Journal on Monday that folks there are getting what they deserve. (An earlier version of this story misidentified Mr. Rosenbaum as an NYU law professor.)\n\nThe people of Gaza overwhelmingly elected Hamas, a terrorist outfit dedicated to the destruction of Israel, as their designated representatives. Almost instantly Hamas began stockpiling weapons and using them against a more powerful foe with a solid track record of retaliation.\u00c2 ... On some basic level, you forfeit your right to be called civilians when you freely elect members of a terrorist organization as statesmen, invite them to dinner with blood on their hands and allow them to set up shop in your living room as their base of operations. At that point you begin to look a lot more like conscripted soldiers than innocent civilians. And you have wittingly made yourself targets. It also calls your parenting skills into serious question. In the U.S. if a parent is found to have locked his or her child in a parked car on a summer day with the windows closed, a social worker takes the children away from the demonstrably unfit parent. In Gaza, parents who place their children in the direct line of fire are rewarded with an interview on MSNBC where they can call Israel a genocidal murderer.\n\nHamas did overwhelmingly win the 2006 Palestinian elections. Still, anyone who covered that election and its aftermath knows that the average Palestinian wasn't voting for \"terror.\" Fatah and the PLO had ruled their territories in a corrupt and thuggish manner, and many people turned out for Hamas in the belief that they'd prove more honest and fair in government.\n\nA brief civil war broke out when Fatah refused to recognize the election results, with the US, Israel and Egypt backing Fatah. When the fighting ended, Hamas had Gaza and Fatah had the West Bank. And Israel imposed an economic blockade on Gaza that persists to this day.\n\nDov Weissglass, an adviser to then Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, allegedly said: \"The idea is to put the Palestinians on a diet, but not to make them die of hunger. The hunger pangs are supposed to encourage the Palestinians to force Hamas to change its attitude towards Israel or force Hamas out of government.\"\n\nThe blockade led to the collapse of Gazan industry and mass unemployment. But Israel's collective punishment approach to Palestinian voters has, if anything, led to an entrenchment of Hamas's position in Gaza. There have been no Palestinian elections since, so any voters who regret their choice in 2006 (the evidence suggests there are legions of them) have not had a chance to correct their decision.\n\nMany have argued that Hamas could have simply elected not to respond to Israeli provocation; that firing crude rockets indiscriminately is both a war crime and ultimately ineffective; and they've put the civilian population at risk so they can grandstand. To me, that makes plenty of sense. But to Hamas? They believe they need an offensive capability to prevent Israel from arresting and killing even more of their members, and that capitulation is ultimately more dangerous to their movement than defiance.\n\nTheir ceasefire demands \u00e2\u20ac\" among them, the release of their prisoners and an end to the economic blockade of Gaza \u00e2\u20ac\" are wildly popular among Palestinians, as shown by the support of PA President Abbas. Mr. Abbas is no friend of Hamas, but there's clearly Palestinian consensus on this question.\n\nSo far, 32 Israeli soldiers have died in the fighting with Hamas and two Israeli civilians have been killed by rockets fired at the country. Navi Pillay, the head of the UN's High Commission for Human Rights, says that both sides have likely committed war crimes in the latest conflict.\n\nIs there any morality or \"right\" to any of this? It's hard to see any, and the prospects for a negotiated end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, dim as they were, have only grown dimmer thanks to recent events. That's good for hardliners on both sides, but terrible for peace.", "html": null, "created_at": 1406275409.743, "image": "http://www.csmonitor.com/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/content/2014/0724-gaza/18765541-1-eng-US/0724-gaza.jpg", "title": "Israel, Gaza, morality \u2013 and who started it (+video)", "feed_id": 10, "updated_at": 1418343343.483718, "source_id": 4, "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Security-Watch/Backchannels/2014/0724/Israel-Gaza-morality-and-who-started-it-video", "id": 5270}], "story_id": 7, "created_at": 1406225013.785}, {"articles": [{"text": "Israel's ultimate goal in the Gaza conflict is to convince Hamas's leadership that future strikes on Israel are too costly to carry out -- no matter how much the Islamic militant group might hate the Jewish state. So Israel's response is harsh. More than 700 Palestinians have died, most of them civilians, including upwards of 100 children. This heavy toll is tragic and tarnishes Israel's image. Such disproportional military operations strike at the heart of \"just-war theory\" and the way of warfare embraced by the militaries of the United States and other Western countries. Yet they are also at the core of deterrence, which demands disproportionate \"eye for a tooth\" operations to succeed.\n\nDeterrent threats can prevent actual warfare, though it is rarely easy. During the Cold War, the United States relied on the threat of a massive nuclear response to deter the Soviet Union from using its conventional military forces to invade Western Europe. America threatened a disproportionate response: A Soviet move along the inter-German border would trigger Armageddon. Nuclear strategists spent much of their time trying to figure out how to credibly promise to do something so seemingly irrational. The famous nuclear strategist Herman Kahn likened deterrence to a game of chicken played by reckless teenagers who drive their cars at each other and wait for the \"loser\" to swerve. Kahn wrote that perhaps the best way to win is to \"get into the car quite drunk\" and, when your opponent is watching, to \"[take] the steering wheel and [throw] it out the window\" -- a pretty solid, if irresponsible, way of convincing your enemy that you are willing to act against your own best interest.\n\nThe point is: To win at deterrence, you have to risk acting against your own self-interest -- or at least convince your enemy that you're willing to do so.\n\nDeterrence, however, often failed in the Cold War. It did stop an all-out nuclear war and tanks rolling through Germany's Fulda Gap, but it did not stop the Soviets from invading Afghanistan or rolling back democratic revolutions in places like Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Indeed, concerns about the need for the credibility required for successful deterrence contributed to the Cuban missile crisis, which nearly led to nuclear war.\n\nDeterrence against nonstate groups and without the use of nuclear weapons (which Israel still officially denies it possesses) is far more complex. The level of punishment dispensed by conventional weapons is, thankfully, far less apocalyptic than that from nuclear bombs -- but that makes it less scary too. Nonstate groups are less responsible to their populations and tend to be less pragmatic.\n\nDespite these problems, Israel has regularly tried to deter Hamas, Hezbollah, and other terrorist groups. The record has been mixed. Fearing the Israeli response, these groups have at times limited attacks or refrained from them altogether, but they (and Israel) have resumed violence when their internal politics changed or because they believed the other side was behaving too provocatively. In addition to their use of terrorism, these groups also have mini-armies, run political parties, and operate schools and hospitals, making them more like quasi-states than a group like al Qaeda -- which isn't deterrable because it has no territory, is ideologically extreme, and has fewer constituents to lose. (Al Qaeda is always the drunk guy pushing the gas pedal down all the way after having thrown the wheel out the window.) Israel and Hezbollah clashed in Lebanon in 1993 and 1996, and then again more massively in 2006, with Israel hitting infrastructure and displacing hundreds of thousands of civilians while attacking Hezbollah's fighting wing.\n\nIsrael's confrontations with Hezbollah often went poorly, but the last major one in 2006 looks better for Israel in hindsight. A few rockets have hit Israel from southern Lebanon during this current offensive in Gaza, but it seems that Hezbollah itself did not launch them. Indeed, all Hezbollah has really offered Hamas in the latest crisis is a supportive phone call from Hezbollah's leader to Khaled Mashaal, who leads Hamas in exile from Qatar. In general, Israel's northern border has been far quieter since 2006 than at any time in recent history. Hezbollah did not suddenly become pro-Israel, but rather it feared the outrage of its supporters and the loss of its own cadre should it step up rocket attacks. Taken as a whole, however, Israel's historical experiences suggest that deterrence is not impossible, but that when it succeeds it is partial and often short-lived.\n\nIn Gaza, Israel has little choice but to rely on deterrence. Israel tried ruling Gaza from 1967 until 2005, when it withdrew in the face of Hamas-led attacks. Despite calls from some right-wing parties, the government in Jerusalem has no desire to take over this basket case again. Ruling Gaza would require Israel to take formal responsibility for caring for Gazans while waging a low-level counterinsurgency against an entrenched and motivated Hamas. Egypt has no desire to play the role either. And with moderate Palestinians like President Mahmoud Abbas weak and further discredited by the crisis, there is currently no alternative in Ramallah to Hamas rule in Gaza. Indeed, the biggest rivals to Hamas are the even more radical groups operating in the Gaza Strip. This is part of the reason Hamas is fighting Israel. Having gained power in part by criticizing Fatah for being passive and negotiating with Israel, Hamas seeks to ensure it is always the standard-bearer of resistance among Gazans in order to diminish the appeal of these die-hards.\n\nYet in Israel's efforts to achieve deterrence, the country has suffered from constant criticism for the harshness of its methods. On Wednesday, July 23, the BBC reported that the United Nations' high commissioner for human rights, Navi Pillay, condemned Israel's recent military actions in Gaza: \"There seems to be a strong possibility that international law has been violated in a manner that could amount to war crimes.\" Referring to the Gazan children killed in a July 16 Israeli airstrike while playing on a beach, Pillay reportedly said that Israel's \"disregard for international humanitarian law and for the right to life was shockingly evident.\" Pillay also condemned Hamas's rocket attacks, but that garnered far less attention.\n\nCritics of Israel's operations that lead to considerable civilian deaths draw on a principle advanced since the time of St. Augustine: proportionality. As part of just-war theory, this doctrine calls for ensuring that the minimum amount of force is used to achieve the objective and avoiding harm to noncombatants. The idea that civilians are inviolate has become commonplace, and with the development of precision munitions that enable more-discriminate targeting, Western militaries, including America's, have incorporated proportionality into their targeting decisions. In World War II, Allied forces leveled Dresden, and the United States dropped atomic bombs on Japanese cities, killing upwards of 200,000 people in order to impel Tokyo's surrender. Despite the flash-bang of \"shock and awe,\" such a thought never occurred to U.S. military planners when the United States invaded Iraq in 2003. And it's clearly not something even the hard-liners in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government would countenance either.\n\nIsrael is trying to preserve an image of itself as adhering to Western principles of justice and proportionality. So it drops leaflets and sends warnings via SMS to notify Gazans that it will soon bomb a building or area where they live and uses small munitions to \"knock on the roof\" to scare inhabitants into fleeing before a large bomb levels a target. And yet, even this war is ugly and bloody: The images of dead children and stories of massive displacement and suffering tarnish Israel's image around the world, including in the United States. Thus we see agreed humanitarian pauses and efforts to allow access to medical supplies. The Israeli military has even opened a field hospital to treat wounded Palestinians, mainly women and children, at the Erez border crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip.\n\nDespite Israel's efforts, the difficulties in harmonizing proportionality and deterrence are many, and often it is impossible. Terrorist groups like Hamas do not wear uniforms. They hide their fighters and weapons among the general population, launching rockets from hospitals and hiding munitions in schools -- explicitly to make it difficult to target combatants and the supplies they need without hitting civilians. Moreover, the media environment in Israel and Gaza is intense and passionate: Millions can die in Congo with few noticing, but death and destruction in the Promised Land is chronicled in minute detail.\n\nBecause Israel is arguably the most casualty-sensitive country in the world, deterrence is even harder. With nuclear weapons and carpet-bombing off the table, Israel needs to go in on the ground to achieve its objectives -- but ground operations can lead to Israeli casualties that actually undermine its deterrence. In 2011, it traded over 1,000 prisoners for Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier captured by Hamas in 2006. Israel has even traded high-level prisoners for the bodies of its dead soldiers. As a result, the body counts for successful deterrence are often staggering and highly disproportionate: In the 2008-2009 Cast Lead operation, Israel killed more than 1,200 Palestinians and suffered only 13 losses of its own -- roughly a 100-1 ratio. This, of course, makes Israel look even more callous.\n\nEven minor Hamas victories complicate deterrence. In the first days of the current conflict, before Israel launched its ground offensive, Hamas fired over 1,000 rockets, but the Iron Dome missile-defense system prevented casualties on the Israeli side -- a one-sided outcome that made Israel look like the only winner. The ground campaign, however, has so far led to 35 deaths on the Israeli side -- a fraction of the estimated 700 in Gaza. That said, it's still a significant number for Israel, and Hamas can claim it is making Israel pay in blood. Adding to the credibility of Hamas's claim, it continues its rocket attacks, it may have captured an Israeli soldier (or at least his remains), and it temporarily shut down Israel's international airport. These are victories -- at least political ones -- that allow Hamas to claim that \"resistance\" is worthwhile and that make it less likely to be deterred than the last time. Particularly because Hamas has been weakened from the Egyptian crackdown on its tunnel network, such victories are necessary for the movement to sustain its authority.\n\nHamas cannot maintain this fight indefinitely, however -- despite its rhetoric, it knows that Gazans have no desire for endless war -- but for now it is betting that Israel will blink first. If Hamas can emerge still standing, or if there is a deal that lessens restrictions on Gaza, it will claim victory.\n\nBut real victories, on either side, are elusive. There is no real end to this dilemma, and it is likely to grow more intense. Even if the latest fighting yields months of peace, Israelis assume that they will have to again strike at Hamas, and perhaps even Hezbollah, at some point in the future. They use the term \"mowing the grass\": If Israel does nothing, the problem will grow out of control. Thus Israel feels compelled to act on a regular basis to ensure its deterrence achieves at least the partial results of limiting the wars and making them less frequent. So even if the latest fighting in Gaza ends soon, it won't be the last round.", "html": null, "created_at": 1406240175.0, "image": "http://www.foreignpolicy.com/files/imagecache/860x/images/gaza452600582.jpg", "title": "An Eye for a Tooth", "feed_id": 46, "updated_at": 1418341036.864701, "source_id": 14, "url": "http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/07/24/an_eye_for_a_tooth_israel_gaza_hamas_deterrence_strategy", "id": 5037}, {"text": "Israel's ultimate goal in the Gaza conflict is to convince Hamas's leadership that future strikes on Israel are too costly to carry out -- no matter how much the Islamic militant group might hate the Jewish state.

In Gaza, open warfare means that not far behind lurks the intellectual equivalent of ricocheting rockets; namely, lawfare. Waged in the media, at the United Nations, and in legal and academic circles, lawfare is a fight over the rules of war, the fate of civilians, and the international legal protocols that purport to govern armed conflict.\n\nLawfare -- roughly defined as the invocation of legal rules, analyses, and proceedings to further a political position in an international conflict -- is not new to the Middle East. The nation-state of Israel was midwifed via a 1948 U.N. resolution that mandated the very two-state solution that remains elusive some 66 years later. While the Jews endorsed the plan, the Palestinians and their Arab neighbors invoked legalese to reject the split, citing a violation of the U.N. Charter's principle of self-determination.\n\nEver since, the Palestinians have looked to the United Nations for support, leveraging their heavy majority of sympathetic post-colonial governments. In 1988, the Palestinians reversed their stance on the original 1948 partition resolution, invoking it as grounds for their claim to a state, an argument that was upheld by the International Court of Justice. In recent years, the Palestinians have stepped up their legal and diplomatic battles, hoping to gain ground that has proven elusive through either negotiation, terror tactics, or intifada-style rebellion. They secured a 2012 resolution at the U.N. General Assembly acknowledging their statehood and have sought membership in several other multinational bodies including UNESCO.\n\nThe rising temperature in Israel and Gaza can be felt in faraway U.N. conference rooms and committee meetings. For diplomats, prosecutors, lawyers, and judges, the horror and futility of rocket volleys, air raid sirens, and little children lying face down in the sand feed a belief that the tools of their craft -- fact-finding missions, investigations, resolutions, referrals, and legal proceedings -- can somehow make a difference. Some ply their trades aiming to help the side they are on; others in an effort to uphold principles and values at risk in the crossfire.\n\nThe frenzy is already in high gear. The op-eds, tweets, and Facebook posts are flying fast and furious. Human Rights Watch and other groups are busy documenting and condemning the killings. Palestinian rights group Al-Haq and left-wing Israeli group B'tselem are excoriating Israel for wanton disregard of civilian life in Gaza. Israel-friendly NGO Monitor is pinpointing Israeli human rights organizations as the prime movers behind an effort to repeat the 2009 Goldstone Report, a UN report that accused both Israel and Hamas of war crimes. And Harvard Law's Alan Dershowitz faults the media for its emphasis on body counts, claiming the lopsided numbers fuel anti-Israel bias and encourage Hamas to use human shields.\n\nThe momentum is growing. On Wednesday, the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva met to hear accounts of the violence and to vote on the establishment of a fact-finding mission to examine alleged abuses. The United States was the only \"no\" vote; 29 countries voted in favor (Britain and Germany were among the 17 abstentions). The special session marked the seventh of its kind focused on Israel's conduct since the council's inception in 2006, though the first in nearly five years. While the investigative mission's mandate is to probe \"all violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights,\" meaning violations on all sides, the text's preamble includes repeated condemnations of Israel's conduct, making clear that it is the prime focus. If the establishment of prior commissions to investigate the 2008-2009 Cast Lead operation and the 2010 flotilla incident are any guide, many of the jurists and experts qualified to serve on such a body will flee from the assignment, seeing only political and reputational pitfalls. Those willing to accept the job will be accused of having an axe to grind; every statement, utterance, and whisper will be probed for traces of anti-Israel animus.\n\nBut long before the fact-finding is carried out and the report written, all eyes will be on whether these latest alleged abuses will bring Israel any closer to an appearance before the International Criminal Court (ICC). Israel is not a party to the court. Nor, for the time being, is Palestine, though human rights groups have urged them to seek membership now that they've won statehood status at the General Assembly. While Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has weighed the idea, Israel has made it clear that it views a Palestinian application for ICC membership as a kind of nuclear option, threatening unspecified retaliation. It is an open question whether the court would view Palestinian recognition at the General Assembly as opening the door to a potential prosecution of Israel, as some have argued it should. Regardless, the struggle will grind on long after the violence itself has ebbed, almost certainly ending in its own equally unproductive and unsatisfying stalemate, one that reinforces Israel's sense of paranoid isolation and Palestinian feelings of frustrated futility.\n\nAmid it all will be a palpable sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu; the scenario is a repeat of what unfolded after Cast Lead, which killed between 1,100-1,400 Palestinians, and caused wide damage to property and infrastructure. Cast Lead crowned a human emblem of misplaced faith in lawfare in the person of Richard Goldstone, the South African jurist who fatefully raised his hand to assume the chairmanship of the U.N. Commission created to probe the 2008-2009 Israel-Gaza conflagration. As a Jew and longtime supporter of Israel, Goldstone was also trusted by human rights organizations and diverse governments because of his work on South Africa's apartheid system and human rights crimes in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. Goldstone believed that despite a one-sided resolution and mandate from the U.N.'s Human Rights Council, he could shepherd a fact-finding effort that both Jerusalem, Ramallah, and even Gaza City might accept -- a breakthrough, in other words.\n\nThough he didn't see it right away, Goldstone's hopes were doomed from the start. Israel refused to cooperate with his probe, dismissing Goldstone's personal assurances as no match for the HRC's track record of bias. With Jerusalem unwilling to tell its side of the story, Goldstone and his panel relied on evidence from Palestinians. The resulting report drew broad and firm conclusions, fingering Israel for deliberately targeting civilians and calling for its conduct to be referred to the International Criminal Court. While Hamas and the Palestinian Authority were also accused of abuses, the Goldstone Report exploded like a bomb in Israel, awakening profound fears of global delegitimization and the international prosecution of military leaders, rank-and-file soldiers, and reservists.\n\nFueled by indignation, Israel initiated its own investigations into the incidents recounted in Goldstone's report, gradually telling its side of the story via reports to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. After Goldstone absorbed the alternative account, he recanted major parts of his report in a Washington Post op-ed. The reaction to his reversal only perpetuated the polarization -- Israel's supporters felt vindicated whereas Palestinian sympathizers dismissed it as craven capitulation to Israeli pressure. The net result left both the report, Israel's standing, and Goldstone's reputation badly battered.\n\nThough it is worth remembering the twists and turns of the Goldstone saga, doing so does not mean the international community isn't destined to repeat them. The obstacles to using the law to effect accountability, much less reconciliation, in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict are entrenched. They derive from the very legal regimes that sit at the heart of Goldstone's legal analysis, its rebuttals, and the new rounds of salvos in the making.\n\nThe conduct of war is governed under the international law of armed conflicts, also known has international humanitarian law (IHL), and codified in the Geneva Conventions and other instruments, which aim to balance imperatives of humanity and military necessity. The law applies three principles: distinction, proportionality, and military necessity to determine whether harm to civilians in the course of conflict is justified. The problem is that in Gaza today -- and perhaps in any modern conflict that involves something other than two relatively evenly-matched armies going head-to-head on a formal battlefield -- none of these concepts can be applied cleanly, if at all.\n\nThe principle of distinction requires combatants to differentiate between military and civilian personnel and targets. From the paltry success rate of Hamas's rocket fire, it seems clear that they lack the capability to distinguish targets, or even select them with any refinement. The law doesn't address this scenario, leaving open whether, absent the ability to distinguish, the obligation to do so falls away or, instead, whether no targeting at all is permitted in that case. As far as Hamas' conduct is concerned, the analysis is even more fraught and inconclusive. As a hybrid political and civilian military movement embedded amid a dense urban population, Hamas's very structure makes distinction between combatants and civilians near impossible. While IHL contemplates that civilians may enter into combat, temporarily relinquishing their protected status, it does not address whether that involvement must be active and intentional, or what happens if the civilians are coerced into participating.\n\nSeeking to minimize civilian killings and international condemnation, Israel has stepped up tactics aimed at differentiating military and civilian targets, using text messages, leaflets, phone calls, and non-lethal \"knocks\" on roofs to warn civilians of impending attacks. While Israel's supporters trumpet the care taken to avoid casualties, in the eyes of its opponents these measures reinforce the Israel Defense Forces' acute awareness of the potential risks to civilians from its every move, and do little if anything to detract from culpability.\n\nMoreover, Hamas is relatively candid that distinction is not in its interest: its arms caches and military equipment are concealed and moved through secret tunnels. During the current conflict, its leaders have urged civilians to flat-out ignore warnings of attacks, to stand their ground in order to deter fire, or failing that, martyr themselves to expose Israeli brutality. International law does not address whether the principle of distinction can be fulfilled, even in part, by Israel asking civilians to distinguish themselves, in many cases by abandoning homes and properties to be hit by enemy fire. While there is no internationally recognized right for civilians to \"stand their ground\" in the face of hostilities that endanger them, nor is there an obligation to flee from imminent danger. Nor does it pronounce on what to do when civilians decline Israel's warning to run either because they can't, don't want to, or are urged by combatants not to get out of the way. The current Gaza conflict is in part a fight between one combatant seeking to distinguish (presumably motivated by a mix of moral conviction and public relations imperatives) and another (out to highlight human costs and stigmatize its enemy) bent on blurring the lines. In such a scenario, the duties of distinction are anything but distinct.\n\nThe second principle governing the law of armed conflict is proportionality. The concept of proportionality contemplates that a certain amount of incidental harm will unavoidably inflict civilians and their property during wartime. But such harm must be proportionate to the military objectives pursued. So a lawful attack on a military objective can become unlawful when the foreseeable collateral harm to civilians outweighs the significance of the military objective. During Operation Cast Lead, Israel's campaign, with its heavy toll in property and lives, was widely decried by U.N. officials and human rights experts as disproportionate. As theorist Michael Walzer noted, the Israeli campaign was judged excessive from day one, before anyone even knew what the damage would be. Today, considerations of proportionality are at least as obscured. Israel's objectives in the current conflict include ending a barrage of more than 1,300 rockets that had been fired from Gaza at the time of the launch of the ground invasion as well as rooting out Hamas's network of weapons transmission tunnels, some leading directly into Israeli territory. Hamas's goals are harder to pin down -- a moral and psychological victory, the mobilization of domestic and international support.\n\nNo jurist could credibly outline what would constitute means proportionate to Hamas's aims. Hamas has already lobbed well over double the number of rockets against Israel as were fired during all of Cast Lead. Yet, Israel's Iron Dome defense system is better able to intercept such missiles than it was five years ago, meaning that the number of hits is fewer. The law doesn't answer whether the strength of a combatant's defenses can render a larger than otherwise number of potentially lethal strikes nonetheless proportionate. If just a single Hamas rocket hit a major civilian target -- say, a plane landing in Tel Aviv -- it's hard to imagine that the proportionality calculus wouldn't shift radically. Though their lethality is limited, the range of Hamas's rockets has increased, putting a larger segment of Israel's territory and population at risk and in fear. IHL does not address whether the operative test of proportionality is inchoate fear, proximate danger, or actual harm. In this case, the level of justifiable Israeli use of force in response would vary dramatically depending on which measure is used. Proportionality must also rest on the shoulders of distinction, in that if military and civilian targets cannot be told apart, direct and collateral damage merge. Absent the ability to distinguish, and with no conceivable yardstick by which to measure proportions, the concept of proportionality melts into nebulousness.\n\nThe third legal principle is that of military necessity, which derives from the Preamble to the 1868 St. Petersburg Declaration, a precursor to the late Hague conventions. The document proclaimed that the sole legitimate objective of war is to weaken enemy military forces and to \"disable the greatest possible number of men.\" Wanton pillaging, revenge killings, and terror campaigns aimed to frightened civilians fail to meet the necessity threshold. The criterion of necessity is perhaps the most pliable of all -- both Israel's and Hamas's attacks could be, and are, described variously as essential measures of self-defense and as pointless, fruitless violence.\n\nAnd that's the problem. Its polarizing contestedness, baffling inconclusiveness, and passionate politicization render lawfare almost entirely unsatisfying as a route to achieve the main goals that tend to motivate its use: finding truth, assigning blame, and advancing resolution of conflict and preventing the next one. That doesn't make lawfare entirely useless, though. Legal and policy debates offer intelligent observers around the world a way to process the horrors of the fight, channeling their high emotions into essays, reports, and briefs that are less dangerous than rockets, bombs, or hate speech. The hot debates over the fate of innocent victims also signify a value placed on human life; we feel better having casualties meticulously documented in a U.N. report than we do when bodies are buried in unmarked and unknown graves. For the dead and their families, though, the distinction may not mean much. Perhaps the most useful consequence of lawfare is its power to expose the inadequacy of current legal regimes to address the deep fog of conflicts that pit sstates against militant groups entrenched among civilian populations. These attributes characterize confrontations now underway in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Ukraine, and across the global battleground of America's counterterror campaign.\n\nBut for all of its meticulous statistics, resolutions, and reports, lawfare lags far behind warfare. In order to be useful, it will have to somehow catch up.", "html": null, "created_at": 1406257931.0, "image": "http://www.foreignpolicy.com/files/imagecache/860x/images/briefcase148129014.jpg", "title": "How Many Lawyers Does It Take to Fight a War?", "feed_id": 46, "updated_at": 1418341036.864923, "source_id": 14, "url": "http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/07/24/how_many_lawyers_does_it_take_to_fight_a_war_war_crimes_israel_gaza_hamas", "id": 5171}, {"text": "The U.N.'s human rights chief, Navi Pillay, accused Israel of potential war crimes on Wednesday, July 23, ratcheting up the rhetoric and the potential consequences of the ongoing battle between Israel and Hamas. In Gaza, open warfare means that not far behind lurks the intellectual equivalent of ricocheting rockets; namely, lawfare. Waged in the media, at the United Nations, and in legal and academic circles, lawfare is a fight over the rules of war, the fate of civilians, and the international legal protocols that purport to govern armed conflict.\n\nLawfare -- roughly defined as the invocation of legal rules, analyses, and proceedings to further a political position in an international conflict -- is not new to the Middle East. The nation-state of Israel was midwifed via a 1948 U.N. resolution that mandated the very two-state solution that remains elusive some 66 years later. While the Jews endorsed the plan, the Palestinians and their Arab neighbors invoked legalese to reject the split, citing a violation of the U.N. Charter's principle of self-determination.\n\nEver since, the Palestinians have looked to the United Nations for support, leveraging their heavy majority of sympathetic post-colonial governments. In 1988, the Palestinians reversed their stance on the original 1948 partition resolution, invoking it as grounds for their claim to a state, an argument that was upheld by the International Court of Justice. In recent years, the Palestinians have stepped up their legal and diplomatic battles, hoping to gain ground that has proven elusive through either negotiation, terror tactics, or intifada-style rebellion. They secured a 2012 resolution at the U.N. General Assembly acknowledging their statehood and have sought membership in several other multinational bodies including UNESCO.\n\nThe rising temperature in Israel and Gaza can be felt in faraway U.N. conference rooms and committee meetings. For diplomats, prosecutors, lawyers, and judges, the horror and futility of rocket volleys, air raid sirens, and little children lying face down in the sand feed a belief that the tools of their craft -- fact-finding missions, investigations, resolutions, referrals, and legal proceedings -- can somehow make a difference. Some ply their trades aiming to help the side they are on; others in an effort to uphold principles and values at risk in the crossfire.\n\nThe frenzy is already in high gear. The op-eds, tweets, and Facebook posts are flying fast and furious. Human Rights Watch and other groups are busy documenting and condemning the killings. Palestinian rights group Al-Haq and left-wing Israeli group B'tselem are excoriating Israel for wanton disregard of civilian life in Gaza. Israel-friendly NGO Monitor is pinpointing Israeli human rights organizations as the prime movers behind an effort to repeat the 2009 Goldstone Report, a UN report that accused both Israel and Hamas of war crimes. And Harvard Law's Alan Dershowitz faults the media for its emphasis on body counts, claiming the lopsided numbers fuel anti-Israel bias and encourage Hamas to use human shields.\n\nThe momentum is growing. On Wednesday, the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva met to hear accounts of the violence and to vote on the establishment of a fact-finding mission to examine alleged abuses. The United States was the only \"no\" vote; 29 countries voted in favor (Britain and Germany were among the 17 abstentions). The special session marked the seventh of its kind focused on Israel's conduct since the council's inception in 2006, though the first in nearly five years. While the investigative mission's mandate is to probe \"all violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights,\" meaning violations on all sides, the text's preamble includes repeated condemnations of Israel's conduct, making clear that it is the prime focus. If the establishment of prior commissions to investigate the 2008-2009 Cast Lead operation and the 2010 flotilla incident are any guide, many of the jurists and experts qualified to serve on such a body will flee from the assignment, seeing only political and reputational pitfalls. Those willing to accept the job will be accused of having an axe to grind; every statement, utterance, and whisper will be probed for traces of anti-Israel animus.\n\nBut long before the fact-finding is carried out and the report written, all eyes will be on whether these latest alleged abuses will bring Israel any closer to an appearance before the International Criminal Court (ICC). Israel is not a party to the court. Nor, for the time being, is Palestine, though human rights groups have urged them to seek membership now that they've won statehood status at the General Assembly. While Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has weighed the idea, Israel has made it clear that it views a Palestinian application for ICC membership as a kind of nuclear option, threatening unspecified retaliation. It is an open question whether the court would view Palestinian recognition at the General Assembly as opening the door to a potential prosecution of Israel, as some have argued it should. Regardless, the struggle will grind on long after the violence itself has ebbed, almost certainly ending in its own equally unproductive and unsatisfying stalemate, one that reinforces Israel's sense of paranoid isolation and Palestinian feelings of frustrated futility.\n\nAmid it all will be a palpable sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu; the scenario is a repeat of what unfolded after Cast Lead, which killed between 1,100-1,400 Palestinians, and caused wide damage to property and infrastructure. Cast Lead crowned a human emblem of misplaced faith in lawfare in the person of Richard Goldstone, the South African jurist who fatefully raised his hand to assume the chairmanship of the U.N. Commission created to probe the 2008-2009 Israel-Gaza conflagration. As a Jew and longtime supporter of Israel, Goldstone was also trusted by human rights organizations and diverse governments because of his work on South Africa's apartheid system and human rights crimes in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. Goldstone believed that despite a one-sided resolution and mandate from the U.N.'s Human Rights Council, he could shepherd a fact-finding effort that both Jerusalem, Ramallah, and even Gaza City might accept -- a breakthrough, in other words.\n\nThough he didn't see it right away, Goldstone's hopes were doomed from the start. Israel refused to cooperate with his probe, dismissing Goldstone's personal assurances as no match for the HRC's track record of bias. With Jerusalem unwilling to tell its side of the story, Goldstone and his panel relied on evidence from Palestinians.

But the UN flatly contradicted that, saying it had made repeated attempts to negotiate a window during which people could safely leave the area but none was granted. It said it had given the IDF precise co-ordinates of the location of the school.\n\nMeanwhile reports emerged that the US secretary of state, John Kerry, had presented both sides with a new proposal for a cessation of violence. It centred around a week-long temporary ceasefire with Israeli troops allowed to stay in Gaza to locate and destroy tunnels; and simultaneous negotiations for a permanent deal, with guarantees by the US, EU and UN that the primary concerns of each side would be addressed.\n\nKerry was said to be awaiting a response from Israel and Hamas before leaving Cairo to return to Washington later on Friday. Israel's security cabinet was due to meet later on Friday to discuss the plan. It will also discuss the option of expanding its eight-day-old ground operation in Gaza.\n\nHamas's leader-in-exile, Khaled Mishal, said a truce must include a guaranteed end to Israel's eight-year blockade of the Gaza Strip. \"We want a ceasefire as soon as possible, that's parallel with the lifting of the siege of Gaza,\" he told the BBC.\n\nThe school in Beit Hanoun in the north of Gaza was one of the grimmest incidents of the conflict, now in its 18th day and in which more than 800 Palestinians \u2013 mostly civilians \u2013 have been killed. Thirty-four Israelis and one Thai worker have died.\n\nBan Ki-moon, secretary general of the UN, condemned the shelter attack, which came hours after the agency had warned that Israel's actions in the Palestinian enclave could constitute war crimes. \"Today's attack underscores the imperative for the killing to stop and to stop now,\" Ban said.\n\nValerie Amos, the UN's top humanitarian official, described the attack on the school as \"appalling\".\n\nThe school was hit while its playground was crowded with families waiting to be ferried to safety. According to survivors one shell landed in the schoolyard followed by several more rounds that hit the upper storeys of the building.\n\nMost of the wounded were moved initially to a local hospital where terrified women and children clung to each other, waiting for news of relatives. A shell exploded about 50 metres from the hospital building as they waited.\n\nFollowing the attack a trail of bloody footprints could be seen crossing the deserted playground, which was littered with abandoned possessions. There were pools of blood both inside and outside the school building; more blood was splashed over wooden school desks.\n\nNour Hamid, 17, said: \"We were packing up to leave when the attack happened. We were standing outside when they started hitting us, some of the women holding their babies. My sister-in-law was one of the injured. There were bodies everywhere, most of them women and children.\"\n\n\n\nLaila al-Shinbari told Reuters: \"All of us sat in one place when suddenly four shells landed on our heads ... Bodies were on the ground, [there was] blood and screams. My son is dead and all my relatives are wounded including my other kids.\"\n\nAyman Hamdan, medical director at Beit Hanoun hospital, told the Guardian that medical staff were treating multiple shrapnel injuries and damage to internal organs. \"Some of the bodies were blown apart. Such a massacre requires more than one hospital to deal with it,\" she said.\n\nMore than 140,000 Palestinians have sought shelter in UN premises during the conflict. Several schools run by UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, have come under fire in the last week. On Tuesday a school in Maghazi, central Gaza, sheltering about 1,000 people, was hit by Israeli shells as an UNRWA team inspected damage caused by an earlier strike. \n\n\n\nThursday's strike occurred during a day of heavy fighting across the territory as Israel pressed ahead with its operation to halt rocket fire from Gaza and destroy a sophisticated network of cross-border tunnels.\n\nThe Israeli military, which said it was \"reviewing the incident\", claimed the incident had occurred during \"heavy combat\" in the area and accused \"terrorists\" of \"using civilian infrastructure and international symbols as human shields\". \n\n\n\nIn the West Bank clashes between the IDF and up to 10,000 people demonstrating against the Gaza offensive erupted in the volatile area around the massive Qalandiya checkpoint between Jerusalem and the West Bank city of Ramallah.\n\nThe IDF said it used \"riot dispersal means\" \u2013 a term used to cover weapons such as rubber bullets and tear gas \u2013 against protesters, who threw rocks and molotov cocktails at them and blocked a road with burning tyres. It did not say whether live rounds had been used.\n\nAccording to Israel Radio the protest appeared to be the largest since the Palestinian second intifada, or uprising, which ended in 2005.\n\nTwo other Palestinians have been killed in confrontations in the West Bank this week.

(AP)\n\nViolence spread across the West Bank on Friday, as Palestinian protests against Israel's assault on Gaza broke out in several areas, highlighting the increasing restlessness of the occupied territory.\n\nAt least five demonstrators were killed in clashes with Israeli security forces, according to local news reports \u2014 two in the village of Hawara, near the northern town of Nablus, and three more in Beit Omar, a southern village close to Hebron.\n\nThe fresh bloodshed came hours after thousands of Palestinians clashed with Israeli security forces late Thursday and well into Friday morning at the Qalandia checkpoint between Israel and the West Bank. One Palestinian was killed and scores were injured, protest leaders said. A second Palestinian initially reported killed was in critical condition after surgery, hospital officials said Friday.\n\nAn Israeli army spokesman said that the reports of deaths in Beit Omar were being investigated. A spokesman for the Israeli border police responsible for the Nablus area said they were aware that at least one Palestinian was killed.\n\nThe latest clashes erupted after Secretary of State John F. Kerry presented his proposal for a Gaza cease-fire to Israel and proxies for Hamas, seeking to prevent the violence from spreading to the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem.\n\nIsraeli cabinet ministers decided not to accept Kerry's proposal for a cease-fire without some significant changes, Israeli news media reported. The government decided to leave the option open in an attempt to improve the proposal, according to Israeli media. Israel wants to retain its ability to destroy infiltration tunnels that are used by Palestinian militants to sneak into Israel from the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn Cairo, Kerry said Friday that the effort to reach a temporary humanitarian cease-fire in the Gaza Strip has fallen short for now, but he vowed that he and other diplomats would keep working to halt the violence.\n\nKerry, speaking alongside U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and Arab diplomats, said the proposed truce could lead to a larger negotiation that improves the lives of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.\n\nKerry said he will leave the region after five days of diplomatic efforts and head next to Paris to try to enlist additional European diplomatic help for the peace process.\n\nKerry claimed progress this week and expressed confidence that the basic framework for a cease-fire would eventually be accepted.\n\nHe acknowledged that Israel \"has some questions\" and concerns, but with evident irritation said the Israeli cabinet vote was engineered to make \"mischief.\" There was no formal proposal on which to vote, Kerry said.\n\n\"There's always mischief from people who oppose certain things,\" Kerry said at a news conference. \"There's a fundamental concept here that can be achieved if we work through some of the issues of importance to the parties. . . . Sometimes it doesn't happen overnight or as quickly as you'd like, but that doesn't mean it can't happen.\"\n\nKerry, Ban and Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry placed no blame for the failure this week and did not directly address whether Hamas was on board.\n\nAmong those Kerry will see Saturday in Paris is the foreign minister of Qatar, which has acted as a go-between with Hamas.\n\nSalvos from Israeli tanks and rockets from Hamas fighters had continued through the early afternoon Friday as Kerry made a last-ditch round of telephone calls to regional players.\n\nFollowing Friday prayers, Palestinian protests against Israel's assault on Gaza broke out around the West Bank.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes Friday hit 30 houses in the Gaza Strip, including the home of Salah Hassanein, a leader of the military wing of Islamic Jihad, another militant faction in the Gaza Strip. Hassanein, 45, and two of his sons, age 12 and 15, were killed in the strike in the southern city of Rafah, Islamic Jihad said. Local reporters in Gaza said the leader was not well known.\n\nThe Palestinian death toll topped 800 as the conflict reached its 18th day.\n\nAmong those killed Friday was Hashem Khader Abu Maria, 45, a staffer for Defense for Children International - Palestine, the children's rights group said Friday. It said he was shot in the chest by Israeli forces \"while peacefully participating in a solidarity march with Gaza\" in Beit Omar after Friday prayers.\n\nOn the Israeli side, at least 35 soldiers, two Israeli civilians and a Thai guest worker have been killed.\n\nIsrael said Friday that a soldier previously listed as missing was killed in battle. The soldier, Staff Sgt. Oron Shaul, was among seven Israeli troops whose armored personnel carrier was ambushed Sunday. The remains of the other six were recovered by Israel. A special military committee declared Shaul \"a soldier killed in action whose burial site is unknown,\" the army announced. Hamas claimed to have \"captured\" Shaul and displayed his photo identification card, but the militants never produced evidence that he was in custody.\n\nIsrael also announced Friday that another soldier was killed by mortar fire launched from the vicinity of a U.N.-run Palestinian school.\n\nIn the West Bank and the predominantly Arab enclave of East Jerusalem, Palestinians declared \"a day of rage\" over the mounting deaths in Gaza. It was the last Friday of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, known as al-Quds Day, and Israeli police attempted to prevent violence by deploying additional police units and allowing only women and men over 50 to attend prayers in the al-Aqsa Mosque in East Jerusalem. Overnight, police arrested 40 Palestinians during clashes in the neighborhood, in which 29 Israeli policemen were lightly injured, Micky Rosenfeld, an Israeli police spokesman, said Friday.\n\nIn Ramallah on Friday, thousands gathered at the main mosque in Qalandia to mourn the death of Muhammad al-Araj, the lone Palestinian killed during the demonstrations overnight. The 17-year-old worked as a cook in a well-known restaurant in Ramallah, said co-workers. Toward the end of the prayers, a preacher urged Muslims to rise up against Israel for its incursion into Gaza.\n\n\"I call upon the armies of the Arabs and the Muslims to stand up for the victims and to seek revenge for the actions of the Israelis who are killing innocent children in cold blood,\" the preacher screamed into a microphone.\n\nAfter the prayers, the mourners carried Araj's corpse, wrapped in a shroud with the colors of the Palestinian flag, down a narrow street toward the cemetery.\n\n\"Enough is enough,\" the crowd chanted, as if talking to Israel. \"You've reached your limit.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the Gaza Strip witnessed one of the worst scenes so far in a war that has put civilians in the cross hairs. An elementary school packed with hundreds of Palestinian evacuees seeking shelter under U.N. protection came under heavy fire Thursday, leaving 16 people dead and more than 100 wounded, including women, children and infants.\n\nThe question now is who did it.\n\nThe United Nations sent a team, including a weapons expert, to the school in an effort to answer who fired the deadly barrage \u2014 Hamas or the Israelis.\n\n\"The mission had to be cut short and the team was forced to leave the area after gunfire around the school,\" said Christopher Gunness, a spokesman for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which ran the facility.\n\nA senior Israeli military spokesman, Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, said Thursday night that \"there was a possibility\" shells from Israeli forces\u00ad struck the U.N.-run school in the northern Gaza Strip. But he also suggested that Hamas mortars or rockets could have been responsible. The Israeli army was investigating the incident \"to see what exactly caused the deaths and injuries,\" he said.\n\nKerry, pursuing his cease-fire efforts from Cairo, did not cast blame for the attack on the school, which complicates his efforts to secure even a temporary truce.\n\nAccording to people familiar with Kerry's proposal, it would call a temporary cease-fire lasting approximately seven days. It is backed by United Nations and is the product of U.N., U.S., and Egyptian negotiators, with Turkey and Qatar acting as go-betweens with Hamas.\n\nThe proposed cease-fire would halt offensive activities but may not require Israel to withdraw its ground forces from Gaza. Israeli media reported that it could allow for the continued destruction of tunnels \u2014 an idea that would likely be opposed by Hamas.\n\nThe cease-fire might also include unspecified incentives to Hamas, including release of a small number of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel and partial payment of suspended government salaries in Gaza, perhaps by Qatar.\n\nThe temporary truce could be a bridge to a long-term deal.\n\nIsrael's former ambassador to the United States, Michael Oren, said Friday that \"if the cease-fire proposal calls for a five- or a seven-day cease-fire that enables Hamas to regroup, reestablish its communication systems and replenish its ammunition, then I don't think Israel will accept that.\"\n\nSpeaking as Israel's cabinet was meeting in Tel Aviv to discuss accepting the proposal or widening its military operation in Gaza, Oren said, however, that if the truce \"allows the Israeli army to stay where it is [inside Gaza] and continue destroying the tunnels,\" then Israel might seriously consider accepting it.\n\n\"The big the question what Hamas's response will be to that,\" he said, adding that Israel would likely not accept a cease-fire unless it was also accepted by Hamas.\n\nThe bombing of the shelter was followed by more mayhem at the massive demonstration Thursday night, when thousands of Palestinians clashed with Israeli security forces at the Qalandia border checkpoint.\n\nIt was one of the largest protests in the West Bank in recent years, underscoring mounting Palestinian anger at Israel and the growing civilian casualties in the two-week-old Gaza conflict.\n\n\"This is the West Bank waking up and saying, 'Gaza is not alone,' \" Lina Ali, one of the protest's organizers, said in a phone interview. Ambulance sirens could be heard in the background. \"We stand by Gaza.\"\n\nAs protesters attempted to march from the West Bank city of Ramallah to Jerusalem, Israeli forces\u00ad fired live rounds, rubber bullets and tear gas into the crowds, according to protest organizers.\n\nEarly Friday, an Israeli military spokesman said as many as 10,000 protesters \"were rioting violently.\" They hurled \"burning tires, molotov cocktails, rocks and even fireworks\" at soldiers and border police. After riot-dispersal measures failed, the spokesman said, the soldiers fired live rounds into the crowds, killing at least one protester.\n\nIf the Israelis turn out to have fired the deadly salvo on the school in Gaza, international condemnation is likely to be heaped on the Jewish state, already under pressure from the Obama administration to end its offensive against Hamas, the militant Islamist movement that controls Gaza.\n\nIf it turns out Hamas is responsible for killing its own people with errant rocket or mortar fire, as Israel initially suggested Thursday, then the group \u2014 already branded a terrorist organization by Israel, the United States and the European Union \u2014 could find itself even more isolated.\n\nBooth reported from Gaza City.

One Palestinian was killed and scores were injured, protest leaders said. A second Palestinian initially reported killed was in critical condition after surgery, hospital officials said Friday.\n\nAn Israeli army spokesman said that the reports of deaths in Beit Omar were being investigated. A spokesman for the Israeli border police responsible for the Nablus area said they were aware that at least one Palestinian was killed.\n\nThe latest clashes erupted after Secretary of State John F.

Jim Hollander/European Pressphoto Agency\n\nLarge Palestinian protests against Israel's assault in Gaza spread across the West Bank, and U.S.-led cease-fire talks stall.\n\nLarge Palestinian protests against Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip spread across the West Bank on Friday, as U.S.-led talks to secure a lasting truce sputtered. But a brief 12-hour humanitarian cease-fire did begin as promised Saturday and ambulances rushed into no-go zones to look for dead and wounded.\n\nOrdinary Gazans poured into the streets to resupply and see if homes they evacuated earlier were still standing. Lines formed at banks and shops and residents began to walk back into villages and towns that were battlefields only hours earlier.\n\nIn Cairo, Secretary of State John F. Kerry said Friday that his efforts to reach a week-long cease-fire in the Gaza Strip fell short. But as condemnation against the Israeli rejection of Kerry's terms rose, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to a 12-hour \"humanitarian pause\" in the fighting, which began 8 a.m. Saturday. Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, said that it would also abide by the pause.\n\nThere was rocket fire and aerial bombing right up until 8 a.m. and then it stopped. Israeli drones continued to buzz overheard, and Israel warned that it would not hesitate to retaliate against hostile fire from Hamas.\n\nKerry had hoped to announce a truce between Israel and Hamas on Friday, envisaging a week-long cease-fire that would begin as the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr begins over the weekend and allow time for deeper negotiations that might address Israeli security concerns and loosen Israeli and Egyptian prohibitions on Gazans' travel and trade.\n\nBut Israeli cabinet ministers rejected Kerry's proposal for a cease-fire. Michael Oren, a former Israeli ambassador to the United States, said Israel does not want Hamas, the militant organization that runs Gaza, to use a week-long cease-fire to redeploy its fighters and rockets. Israel also wants to retain its ability to search for and destroy infiltration tunnels used by Palestinian militants to sneak into Israel from the Gaza Strip.\n\nNetanyahu was under no domestic pressure to end the fighting in Gaza, said Oren, who called the mood in Israel \"intensely resilient.\"\n\n\"We have had twice as many losses as we had in the last two operations\" against Hamas in Gaza, he said. \"There is a strong sense that we have to go on and pressure Hamas to reach a fundamental change, that Hamas needs to demilitarize.\"\n\nKerry, speaking alongside U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and Arab diplomats, said he will leave the region after five days and head next to Paris to try to enlist European help.

The number of Israeli soldiers hospitalized has reached 138, according to Haaretz.\n\nFrance's Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius issued a cease-fire extension request Saturday flanked by his counterparts from the U.S., Britain, Germany, Italy, Qatar and Turkey, as well as the EU's deputy foreign minister. Mr. Fabuius also advocated a long-term truce that addresses Israel's concerns about security as well as Palestinian demands to open Gaza borders to allow more freedom of movement and commerce.\n\nAt the Paris summit, there were no official representatives from Israel, Egypt, or the Palestinian Authority, but Hamas was represented by the foreign ministers of Qatar and Turkey.\n\nHaaretz reports that the Israeli cabinet ministers agreed to a four-hour extension to the cease-fire, which would bring it to midnight Saturday local time. However, there's been no official confirmation that Hamas has agreed to an extension.\n\n\"In the security cabinet meeting Saturday evening, ministers will discuss the Gaza operation and the possibility of extending the cease-fire until the morning. The senior official notes that the IDF will not stop operations to destroy tunnels in the Strip during the cease-fire,\" reports Haaretz.\n\nAs The Christian Science Monitor reported, the rough outline of a Kerry peace plan - rejected by Israel Friday - included an initial step of both sides agreeing to an initial suspension of hostilities for at least five days or up to a week, beginning Sunday, to allow for humanitarian assistance to Gaza's besieged civilian population.\n\nSecond, Israel and Hamas would begin negotiations toward a more long-term settlement of the Gaza crisis during the truce, with Egypt playing the role of mediator and the Palestinian Fatah organization participating. According to the plan, the United States, the European Union, and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon would serve as guarantors that the negotiations would work to the end goal of meeting both sides' key demands: for Israel, ridding Gaza of the rockets and tunnels that pose a security threat to the Jewish state, and for Hamas, ending the Israeli embargo of Gaza that for years has choked the small Palestinian enclave\n\nMeanwhile, on Saturday, Turkey lifted its ban on flights to Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport. But it wasn't clear if the ban would resume.\n\n\"Taking into account the current cease-fire situation, the flight ban on Israel's Ben Gurion airport has been lifted, pending a subsequent announcement,\" it said via its Twitter account, reported Reuters. Some 2,500 Israelis were stranded in Turkey due to the flight ban.\n\nThe FAA and some US airlines suspended flights to Tel Aviv this week when a Hamas rocket landed near the airport. But a Iron Dome battery officer intentionally did not shoot down that Hamas rocket because the system projected that it would land a mile away from the airport perimeter, reports Haaretz.\n\n\"The July 22nd rocket attack impacted at a distance of approximately one mile from the airport's outer perimeter fence,\" Giora Romm, director general of the CAAI, wrote in the memo. \"The Israeli Air force, responsible for intercepting the rocket via the Iron Dome system, was aware of the projected impact point almost three minutes beforehand, and realized that it would hit outside Ben-Gurion's borders. In this particular case, the Air force chose not to intercept the rocket, for calculated reasons completely unrelated to Ben-Gurion.\" According to Romm, \"the Civil Aviation authority, in close coordination with The Israeli Airport Authority and the Israeli Air Force, has been working for the last two years on preparing a plan for Ben-Gurion's continued operation in the event of Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel's central region, where the airport is located. The foundation of this contingency plan was the deployment of \"Iron Dome\" anti-rocket defense systems throughout Israel's center, in order to provide this central region's population (numbering over one million citizens), and Ben-Gurion Airport in particular, with protection against rocket attacks.\"", "html": null, "created_at": 1406412464.796, "image": "http://www.csmonitor.com/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/content/2014/7-26-14-ceasefire-screen-grab/18774725-1-eng-US/7-26-14-Ceasefire-screen-grab.png", "title": "Israel extends 12-hour cease-fire, will it go past midnight?", "feed_id": 10, "updated_at": 1418348303.305188, "source_id": 4, "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2014/0726/Israel-extends-12-hour-cease-fire-will-it-go-past-midnight", "id": 6070}], "story_id": 7, "created_at": 1406409037.982}, {"articles": [{"text": "The Israeli armed forces said on Sunday they were resuming their military operation in Gaza after rockets continued to be launched from the Palestinian territory despite Israel extending its humanitarian pause in bombing for an additional 24 hours until midnight.\n\nHamas had refused to join the truce, in a move which risked prolonging and expanding the military confrontation.\n\nA statement from the Israel Defence Forces said: \"Following Hamas' incessant rocket fire throughout the humanitarian window, which was agreed upon for the welfare of the civilian population in Gaza, the IDF will now resume its aerial, naval and ground activity in the Gaza Strip.

Former Labour foreign secretary Jack Straw described Israel's actions as amoral and deeply damaging to its own cause. \"It is time for Israel to stop,\" he told the Observer. \"Both because what it is doing is abjectly amoral but also in terms of its own self-preservation.

(Lefteris Pitarakis/AP)\n\nExplosions rocked a major hospital in Gaza on Monday, causing numerous civilian casualties, witnesses reported, as hopes faded for a break in the three-week-old conflict for the Muslim Eid al-Fitr holiday.\n\nHamas officials blamed Israeli airstrikes for the blasts at Shifa Hospital in central Gaza City, the best-staffed and -equipped in the coastal enclave. Reporters on the scene said women and children were among those wounded.\n\nA spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces said that Israel did not hit the hospital and that the explosions were from failed rocket launches from Gaza.\n\nThe latest bloodshed occurred as international efforts to end the devastating war were intensifying. Early Monday, the U.N. Security Council called for an \"immediate and unconditional humanitarian cease-fire\" in the conflict, which has claimed the lives of more than 1,035 Palestinians and 43 Israeli soldiers.\n\nThe day had started quietly, with many Palestinians hoping to celebrate the three-day Eid al-Fitr holiday that caps the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.\n\nIsrael mostly held its fire overnight, shelling only a site in the northern Gaza Strip in response to rockets fired from there. The Israeli military said, however, that it would continue to destroy underground tunnels that militants had dug to try and infiltrate Israeli territory.\n\nIn an emergency midnight meeting, the U.N. Security Council urged Israel and Hamas, the militant group that runs Gaza, to \"accept and fully implement the humanitarian cease-fire into the Eid period and beyond,\" allowing for the delivery of urgently needed assistance to Palestinians, who cannot leave the territory.\n\nThe statement also called on Israel and Hamas to \"engage in efforts to achieve a durable and fully respected cease-fire, based on the Egyptian initiative.\" Earlier Sunday, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon issued his own personal appeal for a week-long cease-fire.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu heaped scorn on the U.N. statement, saying it focused on \"the needs of a murderous terrorist organization that is attacking Israeli civilians and does not address Israel's security needs, including the demilitarization of the Gaza Strip.\"\n\nIn a telephone conversation, Netanyahu told Ban that the United Nations had ignored Hamas attacks on Israeli civilians and the group's use of civilians as human shields.\n\nNetanyahu warned, \"Israel will continue to deal with the terrorist tunnels, and this is only the first step in the demilitarization.\"\n\nThe conflict raged on Sunday, even as both Hamas and Israel offered brief truces and President Obama pressed Israel for a cease-fire as the death toll continued to rise.\n\nIn a phone conversation Sunday with Netanyahu, Obama reaffirmed Israel's right to defend itself and condemned Hamas attacks, the White House said in a statement.\n\nBut as the administration continued trying to balance its support for Israel with criticism of civilian casualties in Gaza, Obama also urged an immediate humanitarian cease-fire, expressing Washington's \"serious and growing concern about the rising number of Palestinian civilian deaths and the loss of Israeli lives.\"\n\nIsrael denied Sunday it was responsible for one of the most shocking attacks in the 21-day conflict, saying its soldiers were not behind the deaths of 16 Palestinians killed by shelling three days earlier as they sought refuge in a U.N.-run school near an area of intense\n\nfighting.\n\nIsrael's military, however, offered no details about what it called a \"comprehensive inquiry\" into the incident. It released a grainy, 26-second aerial video showing what the military called an \"errant\" mortar shell landing in an empty courtyard of the school as proof that its forces did not kill anyone there.\n\nThe U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which used the school as a shelter for Palestinians fleeing the violence, did not accept Israel's conclusion. Spokesman Christopher Gunness called for an investigation that would be \"fair and objective.\"\n\nThe current conflict has killed more than 1,035 Palestinians, more than 70 percent of them civilians, according to the United Nations. Israel has lost 43 soldiers, the largest toll since its 2006 war with Lebanon. Hamas mortar and rocket attacks from Gaza have killed two Israeli civilians and a Thai worker within Israel.\n\nNetanyahu, in appearances on American Sunday morning talk shows, signaled that he planned to keep targeting Palestinian militants and destroying Hamas tunnel networks, through which the fighters have sought to infiltrate Israel.\n\n\"Israel is not obliged and is not going to let a terrorist organization determine when it's convenient for them to fire at our cities, at our people, and when it's not,\" Netanyahu said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"We'll take the necessary action to protect our people, including, by the way, continuing to dismantle tunnels. That's our policy.\"\n\nIsrael resumed airstrikes on the Gaza Strip at midmorning Sunday, after offering Saturday night to extend a humanitarian cease-fire that had halted fighting in the enclave for 12 hours. But Hamas rejected the Israeli offer to extend the truce for 24 hours. Rockets flew from Gaza into Israel throughout the morning, with six reaching Tel Aviv. Israeli artillery and airstrikes pounded parts of Gaza.\n\nBy the afternoon, Hamas had announced its own 24-hour humanitarian truce, beginning at 2 p.m. local time, to allow Palestinians to prepare for the three-day Eid al-Fitr holiday. But Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the Israeli army, said the military had not received any official order to stop its operations in Gaza and that Palestinian militant rockets continued to soar into Israel past 2 p.m.\n\nShortly before 1 p.m. Sunday, an Israeli airstrike hit a large, empty house in Gaza City's eastern neighborhood of Shijaiyah, the site of fierce clashes a week ago. Three people were killed and at least two were injured, according to witnesses.\n\nNeighbors said the Mortaja family, who owned the house, are not militants but merchants who sell fishing supplies. The people who were killed, residents said, were walking past the house when it was struck and collapsed into a mass of concrete and tangled metal.\n\n\"If we had any suspicions about the house or the family, we would have left the area,\" said a 66-year-old neighbor who gave his name as Abu Ahmed.\n\nJust after 6 p.m., an artillery shell crashed into another part of the neighborhood, sailing in from the direction of the border with Israel, where Israeli forces are positioned. Within 15 minutes, two more shells followed.\n\n\"Can you hear? Can you hear? They are shelling now,\" declared Muhammad Sawah, 20. \"We can't trust the Israelis.\"\n\nSunday night, Israel said it had attacked 40 militant targets, including rocket launchers and a tunnel, since resuming firing on Gaza in the morning. The military reported that 72 rockets were launched at Israel from Gaza on Sunday, with 51 hitting Israeli territory and nine intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome missile-defense system. The others were duds or fell short.\n\nIn the city's center Sunday, thousands of Palestinians emerged out of their houses to purchase salted fish, meat and gifts to celebrate Eid al-Fitr.

(Lefteris Pitarakis/AP)\n\nExplosions rocked a major hospital and a neighborhood of Gaza City on Monday, leaving at least 10 people dead, witnesses reported, as hopes faded for a break in the three-week-old conflict for the Muslim Eid al-Fitr holiday.\n\nPalestinian health officials said the deaths were among 18 reported in Gaza on Monday. They said 70 people also were injured.\n\nHamas officials blamed Israeli airstrikes for the blasts at Shifa Hospital in central Gaza City, the best-staffed and -equipped in the coastal enclave, and at nearby al-Shati camp, also called Beach Camp, a seaside neighborhood filled with refugees from the 1948 war that created the Israeli state.\n\nA spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces denied firing at the hospital and the refugee camp and attributed the explosions to failed rocket launches from Gaza militants. Capt. Eytan Buchman said the army suspects that two projectiles fired from the al-Shati camp fell short or exploded within the camp, one near the hospital. He said the Israeli military had no role in this.\n\nReporters said that an explosion hit the hospital but that there was no serious damage and that it was unclear whether there were any deaths or injuries.\n\nThere were fatalities at the Beach Camp, including at least seven children and four adults, according to witness accounts.\n\nThe latest bloodshed occurred as international efforts to end the devastating war were intensifying. Early Monday, the U.N. Security Council called for an \"immediate and unconditional humanitarian cease-fire\" in the conflict, which has claimed the lives of more than 1,035 Palestinians and 43 Israeli soldiers.\n\nThere were signs of rising hostilities Monday evening. Israeli media reported an infiltration in southern Israel via a tunnel. The reports said that there was an exchange of fire and that five militants were killed.\n\nThe Israeli military made cellphone calls and sent text messages to thousands of people living in Shijaiyah, Zeitoun and Jabalya in the Gaza Strip warning them to evacuate immediately toward central Gaza City. These kinds of mass messages have prefaced large strikes and incursions by Israel over the past three weeks.\n\nSirens also sounded across southern, central and northern Israel, warning people to seek shelter from incoming Gaza rockets.\n\nThe day had started quietly, with many Palestinians hoping to celebrate the three-day Eid al-Fitr holiday that caps the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. It was the briefest of respites in Gaza.\n\nIsrael mostly held its fire overnight, shelling only a site in the northern Gaza Strip in response to rockets fired from there. The Israeli military said, however, that it would continue to destroy underground tunnels that militants had dug to try and infiltrate Israeli territory.\n\nIn an emergency midnight meeting, the U.N. Security Council urged Israel and Hamas, the militant group that runs Gaza, to \"accept and fully implement the humanitarian cease-fire into the Eid period and beyond,\" allowing for the delivery of urgently needed assistance to Palestinians, who cannot leave the territory.\n\nThe statement also called on Israel and Hamas to \"engage in efforts to achieve a durable and fully respected cease-fire, based on the Egyptian initiative.\" Earlier Sunday, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon issued his own personal appeal for a week-long cease-fire.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu heaped scorn on the U.N. statement, saying it focused on \"the needs of a murderous terrorist organization that is attacking Israeli civilians and does not address Israel's security needs, including the demilitarization of the Gaza Strip.\"\n\nIn a telephone conversation, Netanyahu told Ban that the United Nations had ignored Hamas attacks on Israeli civilians and the group's use of civilians as human shields.\n\nNetanyahu warned, \"Israel will continue to deal with the terrorist tunnels, and this is only the first step in the demilitarization.\"\n\nThe conflict raged on Sunday, even as both Hamas and Israel offered brief truces and President Obama pressed Israel for a cease-fire as the death toll continued to rise.\n\nIn a phone conversation Sunday with Netanyahu, Obama reaffirmed Israel's right to defend itself and condemned Hamas attacks, the White House said in a statement.\n\nBut as the administration continued trying to balance its support for Israel with criticism of civilian casualties in Gaza, Obama also urged an immediate humanitarian cease-fire, expressing Washington's \"serious and growing concern about the rising number of Palestinian civilian deaths and the loss of Israeli lives.\"\n\nIsrael denied Sunday it was responsible for one of the most shocking attacks in the 21-day conflict, saying its soldiers were not behind the deaths of 16 Palestinians killed by shelling three days earlier as they sought refuge in a U.N.-run school near an area of intense\n\nfighting.\n\nIsrael's military, however, offered no details about what it called a \"comprehensive inquiry\" into the incident. It released a grainy, 26-second aerial video showing what the military called an \"errant\" mortar shell landing in an empty courtyard of the school as proof that its forces did not kill anyone there.\n\nThe U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which used the school as a shelter for Palestinians fleeing the violence, did not accept Israel's conclusion. Spokesman Christopher Gunness called for an investigation that would be \"fair and objective.\"\n\nThe current conflict has killed more than 1,035 Palestinians, more than 70 percent of them civilians, according to the United Nations. Israel has lost 43 soldiers, the largest toll since its 2006 war with Lebanon. Hamas mortar and rocket attacks from Gaza have killed two Israeli civilians and a Thai worker within Israel.\n\nNetanyahu, in appearances on American Sunday morning talk shows, signaled that he planned to keep targeting Palestinian militants and destroying Hamas tunnel networks, through which the fighters have sought to infiltrate Israel.\n\n\"Israel is not obliged and is not going to let a terrorist organization determine when it's convenient for them to fire at our cities, at our people, and when it's not,\" Netanyahu said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"We'll take the necessary action to protect our people, including, by the way, continuing to dismantle tunnels. That's our policy.\"\n\nIsrael resumed airstrikes on the Gaza Strip at midmorning Sunday, after offering Saturday night to extend a humanitarian cease-fire that had halted fighting in the enclave for 12 hours. But Hamas rejected the Israeli offer to extend the truce for 24 hours. Rockets flew from Gaza into Israel throughout the morning, with six reaching Tel Aviv. Israeli artillery and airstrikes pounded parts of Gaza.\n\nBy the afternoon, Hamas had announced its own 24-hour humanitarian truce, beginning at 2 p.m. local time, to allow Palestinians to prepare for the three-day Eid al-Fitr holiday. But Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the Israeli army, said the military had not received any official order to stop its operations in Gaza and that Palestinian militant rockets continued to soar into Israel past 2 p.m.\n\nShortly before 1 p.m. Sunday, an Israeli airstrike hit a large, empty house in Gaza City's eastern neighborhood of Shijaiyah, the site of fierce clashes a week ago. Three people were killed and at least two were injured, according to witnesses.\n\nNeighbors said the Mortaja family, who owned the house, are not militants but merchants who sell fishing supplies. The people who were killed, residents said, were walking past the house when it was struck and collapsed into a mass of concrete and tangled metal.\n\n\"If we had any suspicions about the house or the family, we would have left the area,\" said a 66-year-old neighbor who gave his name as Abu Ahmed.\n\nJust after 6 p.m., an artillery shell crashed into another part of the neighborhood, sailing in from the direction of the border with Israel, where Israeli forces are positioned. Within 15 minutes, two more shells followed.\n\n\"Can you hear? Can you hear? They are shelling now,\" declared Muhammad Sawah, 20. \"We can't trust the Israelis.\"\n\nSunday night, Israel said it had attacked 40 militant targets, including rocket launchers and a tunnel, since resuming firing on Gaza in the morning. The military reported that 72 rockets were launched at Israel from Gaza on Sunday, with 51 hitting Israeli territory and nine intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome missile-defense system. The others were duds or fell short.\n\nIn the city's center Sunday, thousands of Palestinians emerged out of their houses to purchase salted fish, meat and gifts to celebrate Eid al-Fitr. Others waited in long lines at the local Western Union office, which was closed during the clashes, to receive money from relatives around the world.\n\nMaher Abu Sido, 52, received $700 from his brother in Dubai, funds he had been awaiting for more than a month.

They had been playing outside during a lull in the fighting.\n\nOne man told me he was at home when he heard a huge explosion. He rushed outside and the street was full of bodies.\n\nHamas says the children were hit by an Israeli strike. But Israel denies this - saying the blast was caused by a misfired Palestinian rocket.\n\nThe attack punctured what had been a day of relative calm in Gaza.\n\nToday was the start of a three-day religious festival to mark the end of Ramadan. Some Gazans prayed in mosques damaged by the fighting. You could see children playing in the park on swings.\n\nEid al-Fitr is supposed to be a time of joy and celebration. But for the moment there is only sorrow and anger in Gaza.\n\nMr Ban, who spoke in New York after returning from a visit to the region, was critical of both sides for firing into civilian areas.\n\nHe said Hamas had fired missiles into civilian areas of Israel, while Israeli forces had used high-explosive weapons in the crowded Gaza Strip.\n\nMr Ban said the people of Gaza had nowhere to run to, and he emphasised that participants in conflicts had a responsibility to protect civilians.\n\nHe reiterated the UN's call for an immediate, unconditional humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza during the Muslim Eid al-Fitr holiday.\n\n\"It's a matter of their political will. They have to show their humanity as leaders, both Israeli and Palestinian,\" he said.\n\nLater, the French presidency said the leaders of the United States, France, Germany, Italy and Britain - who held telephone talks - had \"agreed to redouble their efforts to obtain a ceasefire. Pressure must increase to get there\".\n\nWhile Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu is facing increasing international pressure for a ceasefire, at home there is strong public support for the offensive in Gaza.\n\nA poll published by Israel's Channel 10 TV on Sunday suggested 87% of Israelis were in favour - and just 7% wanted a full ceasefire.\n\nThere are concerns about the rising number of casualties among Israeli soldiers but people here want the rocket fire on Israel to stop. The sound of sirens over central and southern Israel has become part of everyday life. And many are very concerned about the new threat posed by the network of cross-border tunnels from Gaza.\n\nAt her home on a kibbutz close to the Gaza border, one woman said she was afraid. Rockets can be intercepted by Iron Dome, she told me, referring to Israel's missile defence system.\n\n\"But there's no Iron Dome protection against Hamas fighters coming up through the tunnels to kidnap and kill us.\"\n\nIsrael launched its military offensive on 8 July with the declared objective of stopping Hamas, the Islamist group which controls Gaza, firing rockets from Gaza into Israel.\n\nOn 18 July, it extended operations with a ground offensive, saying it was necessary to destroy tunnels dug by militants to infiltrate Israel.\n\nAre you in Israel or Gaza?

But the tunnel threat requires a different approach, says Ambassador Oren.\n\n\"A tunnel is a medieval tactic, which is so low-tech that it's quite literally below our radar,\" says Oren. \"Tunnels have been around since antiquity, and we may have to use a medieval technology to combat them, at least in the initial stage....

But despite more than 50 rockets landing in the area since the conflict began three weeks ago, it's not nearly as bad as the last round in 2012, when 25 Katyusha rockets fell in a single week, their whistling trajectory damaging many homes.\n\nBut for many civilians along the border, who are living through their third fight with Gaza in less than six years, the threat from rockets pales in comparison to the worry that Hamas militants could quite literally pop up in their backyard.\n\nMark Joffe, a member of the kibbutz's security committee, says he's not as surprised as some residents by the tunnel threat.\n\nThe army has kept the committee up to date on its efforts to pinpoint and neutralize such tunnels and extra forces were deployed along the border over the past year to counter the threat.\n\nMr. Joffe, who moved to Israel from Britain nearly three decades ago with \"very traditional European left-wing views,\" says he's come to believe that the West misunderstands the nature of the threats facing Israel \u2013 and the response required.\n\n\"I've begun to sympathize with the view that if people are firing rockets at you and digging tunnels, you have to react \u2013 and react strongly enough that they won't do it again,\" he says.\n\nIsraeli officials have yet to spell out just how much damage it believes the IDF must inflict to achieve that goal, as more than 1,050 Palestinians have been killed and Hamas is still sending rockets into Israel \u2013 with more than 2,500 projectiles so far, including mortars that killed at least four Israeli soldiers today near the border.\n\nIsrael has largely protected its civilians against rocket fire with its hi-tech Iron Dome system. But the tunnel threat requires a different approach, says Ambassador Oren.\n\n\"A tunnel is a medieval tactic, which is so low-tech that it's quite literally below our radar,\" says Oren. \"Tunnels have been around since antiquity, and we may have to use a medieval technology to combat them, at least in the initial stage.... We may have to make a moat at 85-foot deep around the Gaza Strip.\"", "html": null, "created_at": 1406599415.365999, "image": "http://www.csmonitor.com/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/content/2014/0728-breach/18781564-1-eng-US/0728-breach.png", "title": "Hamas attacks by tunnel rattle Israelis on Gaza border", "feed_id": 10, "updated_at": 1418343744.714634, "source_id": 4, "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2014/0728/Hamas-attacks-by-tunnel-rattle-Israelis-on-Gaza-border", "id": 7087}], "story_id": 7, "created_at": 1406599415.365999}, {"articles": [{"text": "Despite a history of rocky relations between U.S. President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Obama administration could largely be counted on to watch Israel's back in the U.N.

Security Council, with the backing of the United States, issued a formal \"presidential statement\" demanding that Israel and Hamas implement an \"immediate and unconditional\" cease-fire to end fighting that has left more than 1,000 Palestinians and 43 Israelis dead.

The Israeli cabinet unanimously voted against Kerry's initiative while political figures across Israel's political spectrum accused America's top diplomat of crafting a deal that unfairly rewarded Hamas. Many Israeli officials noted that the militants also rejected Kerry's call for a seven-day cease-fire, as well as a subsequent call for extending a humanitarian pause that Israeli accepted.\n\n\"Both sides are feeling somewhat aggrieved,\" said Robert Danin, a former State Department official and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \"John Kerry feels stung by the Israeli reaction and the way they played it,\" he said.\n\nOn the other hand, he added: \"There is a consensus in Israel that what Kerry proposed was not helpful to what Israel was trying to do.

Security Council statement may serve as a message to Israel about its rejection of the U.S.-backed Egyptian diplomatic initiative.\n\nDanin suggested that the United States may be seeking to leverage its position by playing on Israeli fears of being left to fend for itself at a United Nations that appears to be universally opposed to the current offensive. \"We can be part of this and help you or not,\" Danin said, summarizing the Obama administration's likely message to Netanyahu.\n\nA U.N.-based European diplomat said Washington was likely furious over the way Kerry has been publicly denigrated in Israel. It wouldn't be the first time: In January, Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon was quoted by the Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth as dismissing Kerry's peacemaking efforts as \"obsessive\" and \"messianic.\" He later apologized after the State Department blasted his comments as \"offensive and inappropriate.\"\n\nThe European diplomat said Washington's move was \"an expression of discontent\" and a signal that the United States might be willing to go further in taking action against Israel than before. It was the first time that the U.N. Security Council had taken a formal action on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict since January 2009, when George W. Bush's administration abstained on a resolution calling for a \"durable\" cease-fire to pave the way for Israel's military withdrawal from Gaza. At the time, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the United States essentially agreed with the goal of that resolution, which was supported by the council's other 14 members, but that U.N. action threatened to harm mediation efforts in Egypt to resolve the crisis.\n\nThe Obama administration has been more reluctant to allow U.N. involvement. In February 2011, Susan Rice, then the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, cast the administration's first veto in the Security Council to block the adoption of a Palestinian resolution denouncing Israel's expansion of Jewish settlements. Later that year, the United States killed off a Palestinian bid for recognition as a state before the Security Council by wielding the threat of another American veto. Indeed, since the Obama administration came into power in 2009, the United States had a perfect record of blocking Arab initiatives on the Israeli-Palestinian crisis in the U.N. Security Council.\n\nThe Security Council did previously issue a so-called \"press statement\" urging the parties to abide by a 2012 cease-fire agreement.

His announcement came shortly before a Palestinian delegation, including president Mahmoud Abbas and representatives of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, was due to meet in Cairo for talks aimed at ending the fighting.\n\nIsrael's initial response was dismissive.

Among the targets hit was Gaza's only power plant, where fuel tanks exploded causing huge black clouds of smoke. \"The power plant is finished,\" said its director, Mohammed al-Sharif, signalling a new crisis for the population, which was already enduring power cuts of more than 20 hours a day\n\nGaza endured a night of relentless bombardment that brought some of the heaviest pounding since the start of the conflict three weeks ago, in the hours after the Israeli political and military leadership warned of a protracted offensive.\n\nPalestinian officials said at least 100 Palestinians had been killed in the coastal enclave so far on Tuesday.\n\nIsraeli forces focused on key strategic targets, including the home of the Hamas leader in Gaza, Ismail Haniyeh, and a building housing Hamas-controlled broadcast outlets.\n\nHaniyeh's home was hit by a missile shortly before dawn, causing damage but no injuries.

In a statement it said red lines drawn over the photograph indicated \"the paths of the four terrorist rockets, as detected by IDF radars and sensors, that were launched in the attacks that resulted in one hitting the Al-Shifa hospital and one hitting the Shati refugee camp. Of the other two rockets, one landed at sea and the other was intercepted on its way to the city of Ashkelon.\"\n\nWitnesses in Gaza said missiles had been fired from Israeli F-16 jets. A spokesman for the interior ministry in Gaza, Iyad al-Buzm, said explosives experts from the Gaza police had examined \"the targeted places and the remnants of shells there\" as well as the wounds on the bodies, determining them to be from an Israeli strike.\n\nThe Palestinian death toll stood at around 1,100, mostly civilians. Two Israeli civilians and a Thai agricultural worker have been killed in rocket fire in the past three weeks.\n\nThe renewed bloodshed followed growing international calls for a ceasefire. On Monday the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, reiterated the security council's earlier call for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, demanding that both Israel and Hamas end the fighting \"in the name of humanity\".\n\nThe US president, Barack Obama, told Netanyahu by phone on Sunday of his concern at civilian casualties.

The attack failed, but Israel's response led it to a war of choice in Lebanon.\n\nToday Israel is fighting another war of choice in Gaza. And, just as in 1982, it insists that its enemies are indistinguishable from each other and must be vanquished. But conflating and demonizing the other doesn't make for smart policy and can instead lead to strategic missteps.\n\nIsraeli intelligence quickly worked out who was behind the attempted 1982 assassination: The Abu Nidal group, a radical outfit that had splintered from the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) in the 1970s. Abu Nidal and his followers saw the mainstream PLO as sellouts to Israel and longed for a major military confrontation.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin decided to give Abu Nidal what it wanted. At an emergency cabinet meeting, Mr. Begin brushed aside the information that the PLO had nothing to do with the attempt on Argov's life. \"They're all PLO. Abu Nidal, Abu Shmidal. We have to strike at the PLO,\" he said, according to Israeli historian Benny Morris in his book Righteous Victims. Begin reportedly said the alternative was \"Treblinka,\" the Nazi death camp in Poland.\n\nTwo days later Israeli tanks began rolling into southern Lebanon, the start of a war that became a quagmire.\n\nIsraeli troops occupied parts of Lebanon until 2000, and over 1,100 of their soldiers lost their lives. While the PLO was duly expelled from the country, the invasion added another dimension to the Lebanese civil war. It also led to the birth of Hezbollah, the powerful Shiite Lebanese political party and army that is today a far greater military threat to Israel than Yasser Arafat's PLO ever was.\n\nBegin's penchant then for painting the PLO as monsters, and of Palestinian resistance factions as functionally indistinguishable from each other is echoed today in the fight against Hamas. And while it seems clear that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government is bent on the total destruction of Hamas, it's far from certain that it can be accomplished \u2013 let alone at a price that isn't more damaging than the alternatives.\n\nLet's look back to the precipitating event for the current crisis \u2013 the abduction and murder of three Israeli teenagers near Hebron in the West Bank on June 12. Netanyahu immediately blamed Hamas. His government's official position was that the teens were kidnapped and alive until the bodies were found, while military censors prevented Israeli media reporting that the boys were likely already dead.\n\nWhen the teen's bodies were eventually found, he said \"they were kidnapped and murdered in cold blood by human animals. Hamas is responsible and Hamas will pay.\" Netanyahu sees Hamas in much the same apocalyptic terms that Begin used for the PLO.\n\nImmediately after the teens went missing, Israeli forces swept through the West Bank, arresting hundreds of members of Hamas, among them 54 men who were released from prison in the Gilad Shalit prisoner swap in 2011.\n\nHamas, which had tamped down rocket fire from Gaza to its lowest level ever in 2013, as part of a tacit cease-fire with Israel, responded by unleashing fire towards Israel. Netanyahu said Israel had no choice but to mount a major offensive to dismantle Hamas's military capabilities.\n\nAnd here we are today: a mounting civilian death toll and no clear and achievable strategic outcome for Israel.\n\nBut as in 1982, it doesn't seem Hamas was responsible for the killings. And Netanyahu appears to be cast in the role of Begin, refusing to see daylight between his enemies.\n\nIsrael's prime suspects in the murders (both still at large) are two members of the Qawasmeh clan from the Hebron area. The extended family has spawned many militants who have engaged in terrorist attacks on Israelis. And, just like Abu Nidal before them, they are bent on acting as spoilers towards any initiatives that lead to compromise or cooperation.\n\nAbu Nidal broke with the PLO after the organization began moving towards accepting the possibility of two states and away from its early insistence that the Israeli state should be destroyed. This splinter group assassinated two PLO representatives in the UK a few years before the attempted murder of Argov, and its operations seemed designed at weakening the PLO as much as they focused on Israel. The tactic was simple \u2013 strike out at Israel, and watch the PLO reap the whirlwind. And it worked.\n\nIn the words of Israeli journalist Shlomi Eldar, the real suspects in the murder of the teenagers have played much the same role.\n\nMarwan Qawasmeh, the man behind the abduction, emerged as a dominant figure in the clan after Israel arrested Imad Qawasmeh and sentenced him to life in prison. Each time Hamas had reached an understanding with Israel about a cease-fire or tahadiyeh (period of calm), at least one member of the family has been responsible for planning or initiating a suicide attack, and any understandings with Israel, achieved after considerable effort, were suddenly laid waste. If there is a single family throughout the PA territories whose actions can be blamed for Israel's assassination of the political leadership of Hamas, it is the Qawasmeh family of Hebron. ... Marwan Qawasmeh and Amar Abu Aisha (the other suspect) have brought Hamas to a place where its leadership never intended to go. By kidnapping the three Israelis, the Qawasmeh family decided to take the leaders there anyway. In each of the previous events, Hamas' political leaders were forced to align themselves with the movement's military wing. Not one of them dared to say anything. They wouldn't dare condemn a kidnapping ostensibly intended to release Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, or to denounce some terrorist attack, ostensibly launched in retaliation to the assassination by Israel of some Hamas activist or other.\n\nThough the official government line remains that Hamas was responsible for the killings, cracks are beginning to emerge in that story. Buzzfeed's Sheera Frenkel and the BBC's Jon Donnison spoke to Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld over the weekend. Both wrote on Twitter that he told them that the killers were a \"lone cell\" affiliated with Hamas but not acting on orders from leadership.\n\nAt the time of the murders, Hamas had just initiated a unity pact with Fatah, the political party that runs the West Bank and is headed by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. The hope was that a unified Palestinian front would give them more heft in negotiations with Israel, which continues to expand settlements in the West Bank. But Netanyahu was furious that Abbas had reached a deal with \"terrorists\" and immediately set about undermining the deal.\n\nHere's the International Crisis Group's Nathan Thrall on that now shattered potential:\n\nNetanyahu and his advisers view Hamas as lumpen \"terrorists,\" rather than a political movement with rational goals and strategies that can evolve. That's not to say that Hamas doesn't use terrorism \u2013 it does, witness the crude rockets fired at Israel \u2013 but that the practice of naming a group \"terrorist\" as if all terrorists are the same, can lead to major strategic errors. \"Terrorist\" means that your enemy is irrational and bloodthirsty \u2013 and therefore impossible to counter except by using maximum force.\n\nConsider this op-ed by recently retired Israeli Ambassador to the US Michael Oren, who can safely assumed to be close in thinking to Netanyahu in this matter. He appealed last week for the international community not to work towards a ceasefire and instead to allow Israel to destroy Hamas.\n\nThen he goes on to write about Hamas and Hezbollah that they are \"jihadist organizations no different from the Islamic State and al-Qaeda.\"\n\nNetanyahu expounds a similar worldview. In 2011, he also said there was no difference between Al Qaeda and Hamas. However, as I wrote then:\n\nHamas is not the sort of group to give Israelis the warm and fuzzies. But it has proven capable of moderation. Though its original charter called for the destruction of the state of Israel, its 2006 election manifesto said recognition of the Jewish state was a matter for the \"Palestinian people.\" Its recent unity deal with Fatah \u2013 which was intended to bring non-Hamas technocrats into Gaza's government \u2013 was arguably a signal that it's willing to work towards a two-state solution.\n\nHas Hamas put its signature to a map that indicates it would tolerate a Jewish state next to a Palestinian one yet? No \u2013 but neither has Israel's current leadership.\n\nThere are other Palestinian factions that consider that a betrayal, like Islamic Jihad. Yet Israel continues to strive to present Hamas as bent on world domination, despite its local ambitions. Consider this from the Israeli Embassy in Ireland over the weekend.\n\nRefusing to understand Hamas for what they actually are, and what their short-term motivations for violence are, is probably not going to be productive for Israel in the long-term. It's also not clear how Hamas, or any other militant Palestinian group, can be stopped from rearming, judging by recent history. So Israel's only choice is \"mowing the lawn,\" its euphemism for periodic military operations in Gaza.\n\nIsrael's dramatically greater military strength, coupled with the Iron Dome missile defense system and the small size of Hamas's rockets, meant it had a choice. It could have chosen not to make mass arrests after the teens went missing. Once that was done, it still had the choice to seek deescalation in Gaza. And there's a track record of negotiated truces with Hamas that have held, despite the tensions.\n\nMany Israeli experts doubt that Hamas wanted this escalation. Yuval Diskin, the former head of Israel's Shin Bet security agency, told Der Spiegel:\n\nFor now, the government is choosing a heavy military response, and so far that has proven wildly popular among Jewish Israelis. In 1982, the invasion of Lebanon to \"crush\" the PLO in Lebanon was also wildly popular. When the Israeli minority questioned the wisdom of that approach, they were derided as traitors, much as those who question what's happening in Gaza are today.\n\nBut the consequences and the strategic landscape that this war leaves behind may surprise its architects, much as the consequences of the 1982 invasion of Lebanon did.\n\nAnd if Hamas were crushed, what might replace them? Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, the outgoing head of the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency, thinks he knows: \" If Hamas were destroyed and gone, we would probably end up with something much worse. The region would end up with something much worse,\" he said over the weekend. \"A worse threat that would come into the sort of ecosystem there ... something like ISIS,\" the Al Qaeda-style militant group now rampaging across parts of Iraq and Syria.", "html": null, "created_at": 1406664231.578999, "image": "http://www.csmonitor.com/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/content/2014/0729-world-oenemies/18782794-1-eng-US/0729-world-oenemies.jpg", "title": "For Israel in Gaza, a war of choice and an uncertain outcome", "feed_id": 10, "updated_at": 1418344779.415235, "source_id": 4, "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Security-Watch/Backchannels/2014/0729/For-Israel-in-Gaza-a-war-of-choice-and-an-uncertain-outcome", "id": 7531}, {"text": "Viewing the enemy as a monster only motivated by hate \u2013 and only capable of responding to maximum force \u2013 can lead to error.\n\nOn the evening of June 3, 1982, a Palestinian gunman tried to assassinate Israeli Ambassador to Britain Shlomo Argov as he left London's Dorchester Hotel. The attack failed, but Israel's response led it to a war of choice in Lebanon.\n\nToday Israel is fighting another war of choice in Gaza. And, just as in 1982, it insists that its enemies are indistinguishable from each other and must be vanquished. But conflating and demonizing the other doesn't make for smart policy and can instead lead to strategic missteps.\n\nIsraeli intelligence quickly worked out who was behind the attempted 1982 assassination: The Abu Nidal group, a radical outfit that had splintered from the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) in the 1970s. Abu Nidal and his followers saw the mainstream PLO as sellouts to Israel and longed for a major military confrontation.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin decided to give Abu Nidal what it wanted. At an emergency cabinet meeting, Mr. Begin brushed aside the information that the PLO had nothing to do with the attempt on Argov's life. \"They're all PLO. Abu Nidal, Abu Shmidal. We have to strike at the PLO,\" he said, according to Israeli historian Benny Morris in his book Righteous Victims. Begin reportedly said the alternative was \"Treblinka,\" the Nazi death camp in Poland.\n\nTwo days later Israeli tanks began rolling into southern Lebanon, the start of a war that became a quagmire.\n\nIsraeli troops occupied parts of Lebanon until 2000, and over 1,100 of their soldiers lost their lives. While the PLO was duly expelled from the country, the invasion added another dimension to the Lebanese civil war. It also led to the birth of Hezbollah, the powerful Shiite Lebanese political party and army that is today a far greater military threat to Israel than Yasser Arafat's PLO ever was.\n\nBegin's penchant then for painting the PLO as monsters, and of Palestinian resistance factions as functionally indistinguishable from each other is echoed today in the fight against Hamas. And while it seems clear that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government is bent on the total destruction of Hamas, it's far from certain that it can be accomplished \u2013 let alone at a price that isn't more damaging than the alternatives.\n\nLet's look back to the precipitating event for the current crisis \u2013 the abduction and murder of three Israeli teenagers near Hebron in the West Bank on June 12. Netanyahu immediately blamed Hamas. His government's official position was that the teens were kidnapped and alive until the bodies were found, while military censors prevented Israeli media reporting that the boys were likely already dead.\n\nWhen the teen's bodies were eventually found, he said \"they were kidnapped and murdered in cold blood by human animals. Hamas is responsible and Hamas will pay.\" Netanyahu sees Hamas in much the same apocalyptic terms that Begin used for the PLO.\n\nImmediately after the teens went missing, Israeli forces swept through the West Bank, arresting hundreds of members of Hamas, among them 54 men who were released from prison in the Gilad Shalit prisoner swap in 2011.\n\nHamas, which had tamped down rocket fire from Gaza to its lowest level ever in 2013, as part of a tacit cease-fire with Israel, responded by unleashing fire towards Israel.

The lone power plant also took a substantial hit.\n\nDoes US have the UAE's back? Drafted youth don't think so\n\nSmoke and flames rise from the Gaza power plant after it was hit by Israeli strikes, in the Nusseirat Refugee Camp, central Gaza Strip, Tuesday, July 29, 2014.\n\nIsrael escalated its military campaign against Hamas on Tuesday, striking symbols of the militant group's control in Gaza and firing tank shells that Palestinian officials said shut down the strip's only power plant in the heaviest bombardment in the war so far.\n\nHours after the power plant was hit, thick black smoke still rose from the plant's burning fuel tank. The station's shutdown was bound to lead to further serious disruptions of the flow of electricity and water to the 1.7 million people packed into the narrow Palestinian territory.\n\nThe heavy strikes were a new blow to international efforts to reach a sustainable truce in the fighting, now in its fourth week.\n\nAt least 100 Palestinians were killed Tuesday, including 36 who died in airstrikes and tank shelling on five homes, according to Palestinian health officials and the Palestinian Red Crescent. In one strike Tuesday afternoon, 10 members of one family were killed and 50 people were wounded in tank shelling in the northern Gaza town of Jebaliya, the officials said.\n\nThat pushed the overall death toll since the conflict began on July 8 to at least 1,156, according to Gaza Health Ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Kidra.\n\nIsrael has reported 53 soldiers and three civilians killed.\n\nIn the West Bank, a top PLO official offered a 24-hour truce Tuesday, saying he also spoke in the name of Hamas, but the Islamic militants said they want to hear from Israel first. Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev declined comment.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday warned of a \"prolonged\" campaign against Hamas.\n\nBut it was not clear if Netanyahu has decided to expand the Gaza war into an all-out effort to topple Hamas or planned to limit Israel's operation to the previously stated goal of ending Hamas rocket fire and destroying Hamas's sophisticated network of cross-border tunnels.\n\nAlready, the intensity and the scope of the current Gaza operation is on par with an invasion five years ago, which ended with a unilateral Israeli withdrawal after hitting Hamas hard.\n\nOn Tuesday, Israeli warplanes carried out dozens of attacks, leveling the home of the top Hamas leader in Gaza, Ismail Haniyeh, and damaging the offices of the movement's Al-Aqsa satellite TV station, a central mosque in Gaza City and government offices.\n\nHaniyeh's house, in a narrow alley of the Shati refugee camp, was reduced to rubble but no one was hurt. Residents placed a large framed portrait of Haniyeh atop the wreckage and draped it with green Hamas flags and Palestinian national banners.\n\nIsrael has targeted several homes of Hamas leaders but none has been killed \u2014 presumably because they have kept a low profile. Haniyeh said in a statement Tuesday that \"destroying stones will not break our determination.\"\n\nThe scene at the Gaza power plant after two tank shells hit one of three fuel tanks was daunting. \"We need at least one year to repair the power plant, the turbines, the fuel tanks and the control room,\" said Fathi Sheik Khalil of the Gaza Energy Authority. \"Everything was burned.\"\n\nHe said crew members who had been trapped by the fire for several hours were evacuated.\n\nEven before the shutdown, Gaza residents only had electricity for about three hours a day because fighting had damaged power lines. Most of the power lines from Israel that provided electricity for payment were previously damaged in the fighting.\n\nThis means most of Gaza will now be without power. The lack of electricity will also affect water supplies, since power is needed to operate water pumps.\n\nLt. Col.

(AP)\n\nPalestinian health officials say at least 16 people were killed after on Wednesday tank shells hit a United Nations school in Gaza where hundreds of Palestinians sought refuge from Israeli attacks. (AP)\n\nIsraeli artillery shells slammed into U.N.-run school sheltering evacuees from the Gaza conflict early Wednesday, killing at least 16 people and wounding dozens of others as they slept, according to Palestinian health officials and the U.N. agency in charge of the school.\n\nThe Israeli military later announced that it would implement a temporary humanitarian cease-fire in the Gaza Strip between 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. Wednesday. The cease-fire would not apply to areas in which Israeli military is currently operating, it said.\n\nThe U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which operated the school-turned-shelter in the territory's Jebaliya refugee camp, said the facility was shelled by Israeli forces and condemned what it called a serious violation of international law. The Israeli army said it was investigating.\n\nIn a statement, UNRWA called the attack on the Jebaliya Primary School for Girls \"a source of universal shame.\"\n\n\"Last night, children were killed as they slept next to their parents on the floor of a classroom in a U.N.-designated shelter in Gaza,\" the agency said. \"We have visited the site and gathered evidence,\" it added. \"We have analyzed fragments, examined craters and other damage. Our initial assessment is that it was Israeli artillery that hit our school, in which 3,300 people had sought refuge.\"\n\nUNRWA spokesman Chris Gunness said it was the sixth time that one of the organization's schools has been struck.\n\nIsrael has said some of the facilities are used by Hamas militants to store rockets that are later fired on civilian populations in Israel. Gunness refused to comment on this, even though the United Nations has said it found rockets hidden on its premises.\n\nA spokesman for the Israeli army, Capt. Eytan Buchman, said Israeli forces in Gaza came under mortar fire earlier Wednesday from a point near the school in the Jebaliya camp and responded toward the source of the fire. The incident is being reviewed, he said.\n\nGaza Health Ministry officials said 40 people were killed in Israeli strikes overnight and more than 110 injured as Israel pressed ahead with its escalated campaign against the coastal enclave. The Palestinian death toll rose to more than 1,270 people, most of them civilians, according to the United Nations. Israel has lost 53 soldiers in the conflict, its largest toll since its 2006 war in Lebanon. Mortar and rocket attacks from Gaza have also killed two Israeli civilians and a Thai worker.\n\nThe school strike came one day after some of the heaviest Israeli bombardment in the conflict, during which Israel disabled Gaza's only electricity plant, leaving the crowded territory's 1.8 million residents with no electricity or running water.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned his country in a televised address Monday evening to be prepared for a prolonged campaign against Hamas, the Islamist militant group that rules the Gaza Strip. Israel has said it cannot stop until it dismantles a network of tunnels it says are used by militants to infiltrate into Israel from Gaza.\n\nWitnesses at the Jebaliya Primary School for Girls said shelling struck a classroom where some 50 people, mostly women and children, were sleeping. The classroom's roof was ripped apart. Most of the dead, however, were young men, who had woken for the traditional Muslim dawn prayer, said Moen al-Masr, a doctor at the Kamal Odwan hospital. He said 10 people were seriously injured in the attack.\n\n\"We found people torn to pieces,\" said Allah al-Bes, 33, who was seeking refuge at the school with his wife and three boys. \"It was like hell.\" Bes and his family went to the school after an earlier attack on a U.N.-run school in Beit Hanoun. \"We have learned no place is safe in Gaza,\" he said.\n\nExpanding its list of targets Tuesday, Israel destroyed the family home of Ismail Haniyeh, the top leader of Hamas. Other airstrikes hit Hamas's al-Aqsa television broadcast center, a finance building and the homes of local mayors. Haniyeh is in hiding and his whereabouts are unknown.\n\nAlong the coast of the seaside enclave, Israel also hit a fishing harbor near hotels where scores of international journalists are staying. Airstrikes also hit the Rafah area, along Gaza's border with Egypt, according to local news reports.\n\nIsrael said Tuesday afternoon that its forces had come under attack from militants in Gaza emerging from a concealed tunnel. A gun battle followed, although no details were immediately available. The Israeli military reported a similar infiltration Monday evening, saying five soldiers were killed in a battle with militants from Gaza who entered southern Israel via a tunnel. At least one militant died.\n\nRocket barrages from Gaza sent people in Tel Aviv, Israel's commercial capital, scurrying to shelters early Tuesday.\n\nIn the center of Gaza City, an airstrike obliterated al-Amin Mohammed Mosque opposite the Gaza home of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. In 2007, when it seized control of Gaza, Hamas took over the home and used it to house senior leaders. The militants handed it back to Abbas earlier this year after Hamas and the Palestinian Authority reached an agreement on forming a unity government.\n\nNeighbors said that the mosque was not Hamas-run and that anyone could pray there.\n\n\"This is a mosque for the public, and I am one of the public,\" said Muhammed Abdu, a 45-year-old engineer, as he looked at a cavernous hole filed with debris where the mosque had stood. \"This is all part of a strategy to burn Gaza down.\"\n\nHe said the attack underscored the need for a cease-fire. But like many Gazans interviewed over the past two days, Abdu said the core Palestinian demand of lifting an economic blockade by Israel and Egypt should be met.\n\n\"To bring milk in for your child, is that a crime?\" Abdu asked. \"To have an open crossing so that you can leave for medical care, is that a crime? To travel outside for your business, is that a crime?\"\n\nNear the Nusairat refu\u00adgee camp, in the middle of the Gaza Strip, the shattered fuel tank of the territory's primary power plant continued to emit flames and thick plumes of smoke hours after being hit.\n\nThe plant is Gaza's primary source of electricity, powering sewage treatment systems, water pumps and hospitals, said Dardasawi, the Palestinian official. It is especially important, he added, because six of eight electricity supply lines that run from Israel were damaged. Egypt also supplies some electricity, he added, but hardly enough to power the border town of Rafah.\n\n\"This is like a time bomb,\" said Dardasawi, referring to the potential humanitarian crisis.\n\nOutside Haniyeh's wrecked house in the Beach Camp neighborhood of Gaza City, neighbors gathered Tuesday to express anger. Not far away, 10 people, including seven children, were killed in an attack Monday that Hamas and Israel blamed on each other.\n\nNeighbors said Haniyeh and his family had not lived in the house since the conflict erupted. The dwelling, they said, was hit around 2 a.m., and no one was killed or injured.

The United Nations said about 70 percent of those killed were civilians.\n\nExpanding its list of targets, Israel destroyed the family home of Ismail Haniyeh, the top leader of the Islamist militant group that controls Gaza. Other airstrikes hit Hamas's al-Aqsa television broadcast center, a finance building and the homes of local mayors. Haniyeh is in hiding and his whereabouts are unknown, but he has delivered prerecorded televised addresses.\n\nAlong the coast of the tiny seaside enclave, Israel also hit a fishing harbor, causing hotels where scores of international journalists are staying to shake.

Experts say Egypt's shift vis-\u00e0-vis Hamas has made diplomacy much harder.\n\nUS Secretary of State John Kerry speaks with Qatari Foreign Minister Khaled al-Attiyah (r.) and Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu (l.) at their meeting regarding a cease-fire between Hamas and Israel in Gaza, Saturday, July 26, 2014, at the US ambassador's residence in Paris, France.\n\nLast week's round-the-clock but ultimately unsuccessful effort by Secretary of State John Kerry to secure a cease-fire in the increasingly costly Gaza war has come under withering criticism, particularly in Israel, for offering too big a stage to Hamas and its supporters in the region.\n\nThe Israeli press has been especially brutal with the top US diplomat, accusing him of betraying Israel by circulating a draft cease-fire document that did not meet all of Israel's demands concerning Hamas, the militant Palestinian group that governs the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe harsh tenor of that criticism could help explain why diplomatic efforts on Gaza so far have failed. But more important than a sudden surge in Israeli vitriol toward the US, some regional experts say, are the shifts in the Middle East's political orientation and balance of power since the US brokered the last Gaza cease-fire, in 2012.\n\n\"The regional constellation is very different from 2012, and in ways that make the diplomacy for getting some kind of cease-fire agreement in this conflict much harder than it was just a couple of years ago,\" says Robert Danin, senior fellow for Middle East studies at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) in Washington.\n\nAnd the biggest change, he and other experts say, is with Egypt.\n\n\"Egypt doesn't have the relationship with Hamas that it did, and its conception of its interests are very different from 2012,\" Mr. Danin says.\n\nIndeed, President Obama dispatched former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to Egypt in 2012 \u2013 as hostilities between Israel and Hamas flared but before Israel launched a ground incursion \u2013 knowing that his envoy was meeting with an interlocutor who had influence with the Hamas leadership.\n\nThat is no longer the case today.\n\n\"In 2012 you had [former Egyptian President] Mohamed Morsi, an indispensable interlocutor who could work with Hamas and deliver them\" on a cease-fire agreement, says Daniel Levy, director of the Middle East and North Africa Program at the European Council on Foreign Relations in London. \"Today, under [Egyptian President Abdel Fattah] al-Sisi, you have an Egypt taking sides against Hamas.\"\n\nIf anything, Mr. Levy says, Egypt under Mr. al-Sisi \u2013 who as commander in chief of the Egyptian Armed Forces deposed Mr. Morsi, whose Muslim Brotherhood is the source organization of Hamas \u2013 \"probably has more far-reaching goals vis-\u00e0-vis Hamas for this war than does Israel.\"\n\nThe shift in Egypt also meant that Kerry had no one to turn to in the region who was in some level of communication with all of the players involved in the conflict. \"No party is in a position to talk to all sides,\" Danin says. The US does not work with Hamas, which it lists as a terrorist organization.\n\nThat reality prompted Kerry to turn elsewhere \u2013 specifically to Turkey and Qatar \u2013 for interlocutors with Hamas. It was in doing so that Kerry and his diplomatic initiative reaped the most stinging criticism.\n\nEspecially galling to some Israelis was the sight of Kerry making a high-profile stop in Paris on Saturday to meet with the foreign ministers of Turkey and Qatar, two countries that have not held back in their criticism of Israel's operation in Gaza. Turkish officials in particular have spouted attacks on Israel that at their worst have verged on anti-Semitism.\n\nDanin says he doesn't doubt that both Israel and moderate Arabs understand the useful role that Turkey and Qatar can play in addressing the conflict. Instead it was the \"pride of place\" afforded the two Hamas supporters \u2013 and by extension Hamas's demands \u2013 that was jarring, he says. \"It enshrined them [in the process] in a way that Egypt in particular was not prepared to accept,\" he says.\n\nBut without Egypt, Kerry had to turn somewhere to nail down commitments from Hamas for a cease-fire, Levy says. \"It was the right thing to do to work with the Turks and the Qataris,\" he says. \"You need someone to act as guarantors on the Hamas side.\"\n\nLevy says he suspects that another reason Kerry's consulting of Hamas's friends in the region became such a source of tension between the US and Israel is that it underscored the different conceptions the two seem to have of what a cease-fire would be.\n\n\"The Israelis had led Kerry to believe they wanted a cease-fire, but that is different from wanting Hamas defeated,\" Levy says. \"If you really want a cease-fire and not a Hamas surrender, then you have to have Hamas on board,\" he adds. \"And that requires working with those, in this case the Turks and Qataris, who could get them on board.\"\n\nThat perspective is rejected by some Israelis, who are now questioning any future role for Kerry in negotiating an end to the Gaza war.

Experts say Egypt's shift vis-\u00e0-vis Hamas has made diplomacy much harder.\n\nUS Secretary of State John Kerry speaks with Qatari Foreign Minister Khaled al-Attiyah (r.) and Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu (l.) at their meeting regarding a cease-fire between Hamas and Israel in Gaza, Saturday, July 26, 2014, at the US ambassador's residence in Paris, France.\n\nLast week's round-the-clock but ultimately unsuccessful effort by Secretary of State John Kerry to secure a cease-fire in the increasingly costly Gaza war has come under withering criticism, particularly in Israel, for offering too big a stage to Hamas and its supporters in the region.\n\nThe Israeli press has been especially brutal with the top US diplomat, accusing him of betraying Israel by circulating a draft cease-fire document that did not meet all of Israel's demands concerning Hamas, the militant Palestinian group that governs the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe harsh tenor of that criticism could help explain why diplomatic efforts on Gaza so far have failed. But more important than a sudden surge in Israeli vitriol toward the US, some regional experts say, are the shifts in the Middle East's political orientation and balance of power since the US brokered the last Gaza cease-fire, in 2012.\n\n\"The regional constellation is very different from 2012, and in ways that make the diplomacy for getting some kind of cease-fire agreement in this conflict much harder than it was just a couple of years ago,\" says Robert Danin, senior fellow for Middle East studies at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) in Washington.\n\nAnd the biggest change, he and other experts say, is with Egypt.\n\n\"Egypt doesn't have the relationship with Hamas that it did, and its conception of its interests are very different from 2012,\" Mr. Danin says.\n\nIndeed, President Obama dispatched former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to Egypt in 2012 \u2013 as hostilities between Israel and Hamas flared but before Israel launched a ground incursion \u2013 knowing that his envoy was meeting with an interlocutor who had influence with the Hamas leadership.\n\nThat is no longer the case today.\n\n\"In 2012 you had [former Egyptian President] Mohamed Morsi, an indispensable interlocutor who could work with Hamas and deliver them\" on a cease-fire agreement, says Daniel Levy, director of the Middle East and North Africa Program at the European Council on Foreign Relations in London. \"Today, under [Egyptian President Abdel Fattah] al-Sisi, you have an Egypt taking sides against Hamas.\"\n\nIf anything, Mr. Levy says, Egypt under Mr. al-Sisi \u2013 who as commander in chief of the Egyptian Armed Forces deposed Mr. Morsi, whose Muslim Brotherhood is the source organization of Hamas \u2013 \"probably has more far-reaching goals vis-\u00e0-vis Hamas for this war than does Israel.\"\n\nThe shift in Egypt also meant that Kerry had no one to turn to in the region who was in some level of communication with all of the players involved in the conflict. \"No party is in a position to talk to all sides,\" Danin says. The US does not work with Hamas, which it lists as a terrorist organization.\n\nThat reality prompted Kerry to turn elsewhere \u2013 specifically to Turkey and Qatar \u2013 for interlocutors with Hamas. It was in doing so that Kerry and his diplomatic initiative reaped the most stinging criticism.\n\nEspecially galling to some Israelis was the sight of Kerry making a high-profile stop in Paris on Saturday to meet with the foreign ministers of Turkey and Qatar, two countries that have not held back in their criticism of Israel's operation in Gaza. Turkish officials in particular have spouted attacks on Israel that at their worst have verged on anti-Semitism.\n\nDanin says he doesn't doubt that both Israel and moderate Arabs understand the useful role that Turkey and Qatar can play in addressing the conflict. Instead it was the \"pride of place\" afforded the two Hamas supporters \u2013 and by extension Hamas's demands \u2013 that was jarring, he says. \"It enshrined them [in the process] in a way that Egypt in particular was not prepared to accept,\" he says.\n\nBut without Egypt, Kerry had to turn somewhere to nail down commitments from Hamas for a cease-fire, Levy says. \"It was the right thing to do to work with the Turks and the Qataris,\" he says. \"You need someone to act as guarantors on the Hamas side.\"\n\nLevy says he suspects that another reason Kerry's consulting of Hamas's friends in the region became such a source of tension between the US and Israel is that it underscored the different conceptions the two seem to have of what a cease-fire would be.\n\n\"The Israelis had led Kerry to believe they wanted a cease-fire, but that is different from wanting Hamas defeated,\" Levy says. \"If you really want a cease-fire and not a Hamas surrender, then you have to have Hamas on board,\" he adds. \"And that requires working with those, in this case the Turks and Qataris, who could get them on board.\"\n\nThat perspective is rejected by some Israelis, who are now questioning any future role for Kerry in negotiating an end to the Gaza war. But Danin, a longtime US diplomat in the Middle East, says it is \"premature\" to \"conclude this war will end without an American role.\"\n\nWashington has been \"startled at the degree to which Israelis have been critical of Kerry and his effort,\" Danin says. But he says experience suggests that in a few days \"this US-Israel spat will be behind us.\"\n\nKerry's inability to get a cease-fire \"doesn't mean this effort is over,\" Danin insists. \"There's going to be more American diplomacy.\"", "html": null, "created_at": 1406689401.098999, "image": "http://www.csmonitor.com/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/content/2014/0729-kerry-cease-fire/18787136-1-eng-US/0729-kerry-cease-fire.jpg", "title": "No Gaza cease-fire: Dramatic shift in Egypt deprived Kerry of vital tool", "feed_id": 12, "updated_at": 1418345361.466857, "source_id": 4, "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Foreign-Policy/2014/0729/No-Gaza-cease-fire-Dramatic-shift-in-Egypt-deprived-Kerry-of-vital-tool", "id": 7830}], "story_id": 7, "created_at": 1406689401.098999}, {"articles": [{"text": "At least 15 Palestinians were killed and about 90 injured early on Wednesday when a UN school sheltering people was hit by shells during a second night of relentless bombardment that followed an Israeli warning of a protracted military campaign.\n\n\n\nGaza health officials said at least 43 people died in intense air strikes and tank shelling of Jabaliya, a neighbourhood of Gaza City.

We fled and they (the Israelis) are following us.\"\n\nFour of the dead were killed just outside the school compound, two in their home nearby and two in the street, after returning from pre-dawn prayers, their relatives said.\n\nThe bodies of two members of the al-Najar family, 56-year-old Shaher and his 41-year-old brother, Bassem, were laid out in one of the rooms of their small home, surrounded by wailing relatives. Outside the gate, another relative held on to his crying son, hugging him tight and saying: \"I'm here, I'm not going anywhere.\"\n\nAbu Hasna, the UN agency spokesman, said the international community must step in.\n\n\"It's the responsibility of the world to tell us what we shall do with more than 200,000 people who are inside our schools, thinking that the UN flag will protect them,\" he said. \"This incident today proves that no place is safe in Gaza.\"\n\nAshraf al-Kidra, a Gaza health official, said at least 15 people were killed and about 90 wounded in the school strike.\n\nIn all, 55 Palestinians were killed by airstrikes and tank shelling in different areas of Gaza on Wednesday, al-Kidra said.\n\nIn the southern town of Khan Younis, 10 members of one family died when an airstrike hit a relative's home where they had sought refuge, al-Kidra said.\n\nAfter the strike, relatives climbed over piles of debris, surveying shattered windows and demolished walls.\n\n\"I was sleeping, me and my brother and one of my relatives, we were sleeping. And we tried to look through the window to see what happened. But we couldn't see anything because of the smoke. And when we came down, we saw everything was damaged,\" said Mohammed al-Astal, a relative.\n\nIn the Gaza City neighborhood of Tufah, shelling killed at last seven members of another family, including four children, said Ayman Sahabani, the head of the emergency room at Gaza's Shifa Hospital.\n\nThe total number of Palestinians killed since the start of fighting July 8 rose to 1,284, al-Kidra said. More than 7,100 Palestinians have been wounded.\n\nIsrael has lost 53 soldiers and three civilians.\n\nIsrael says its Gaza operation is meant to stop Hamas rocket and mortar fire that has reached increasingly deeper into its territory and to destroy a sophisticated network of tunnels used for attacks in Israel.\n\nGaza militants have fired more than 2,600 rockets toward Israel over the past three weeks, according to the Israeli army.\n\nThe Israeli military has said it is hitting targets linked to militants, such as rocket launching sites, weapon depots and Hamas' tunnels. Over the past 23 days, Israeli forces have hit 4,100 targets in Gaza, about one-third connected to the militants' ability to launch rockets at Israel, a statement said.\n\nThe military has not provided details on strikes in which multiple members of one family were killed. There have been several dozen such strikes, according to the Palestinian human rights group Al- Mezan.\n\nThe military says Hamas militants often launch rockets from crowded residential areas, thus endangering civilians. The army says it has also given civilians a chance to leave dangerous areas by sending warnings in phone calls and leaflets.\n\nOn Wednesday, aircraft dropped leaflets over Gaza City's Rimal neighborhood, urging residents to stay away from Hamas militants and to report possible rocket launches. The leaflet gave a contact phone number and email and warned of a new operation.\n\n\"The army is warning residents in the areas where the operation will take place that for your safety, you have to keep away from terrorists and the locations from which they operate,\" the leaflet said.\n\nIsraeli leaders have said that troops would not leave until all the Hamas tunnels have been demolished.\n\nThe army said 32 tunnels have so far been located but did not say how many remain. Since Tuesday morning, troops have demolished three more tunnels, a statement said.", "html": null, "created_at": 1406743411.401, "image": "http://www.csmonitor.com/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/content/2014/0730-world-latestnews-gazaschoolhit/18788359-1-eng-US/0730-world-latestnews-gazaschoolhit.jpg", "title": "15 killed after Israel shells Gaza UN school being used as shelter, aid workers say", "feed_id": 10, "updated_at": 1418346214.384003, "source_id": 4, "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Latest-News-Wires/2014/0730/15-killed-after-Israel-shells-Gaza-UN-school-being-used-as-shelter-aid-workers-say", "id": 8189}], "story_id": 7, "created_at": 1406743411.401}, {"articles": [{"text": "The White House reacted to the shelling of a United Nations school in Gaza that killed at least 16 Palestinians with an unusually firm condemnation on Wednesday, expressing serious concern that thousands of civilians sheltering at supposed UN havens are now at risk.\n\nThe girls' elementary school, where 3,300 civilians were taking shelter after being told by Israel to leave their homes, was shelled earlier in the day in an attack that also injured about 100.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon directly accused Israel of shelling a U.N.-protected shelter housing more than 3,000 Palestinians in Gaza as part of what he said was an \"outrageous\" and \"unjustifiable\" strike that left at least 16 civilians dead and lent urgency to the need for an \"immediate, unconditional cease-fire.\"\n\nIn a scorching rebuke from the normally mild-mannered diplomat, Ban charged that Israel's action constituted a \"reprehensible\" assault on civilians and demanded that those responsible for the strike be held accountable. The shelling of the Jabalia Elementary Girls School marked the fifth time since the conflict began on July 8 that a U.N.-protected shelter has been hit with incoming fire, but the incident is the first time that Ban has directly blamed Israel.

All available evidence points to Israeli artillery as the cause,\" Ban said during a stop-off in Costa Rica. \"Nothing is more shameful than attacking sleeping children.\"\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces say that they did not intentionally target the U.N. facility. Instead, a spokesman for the Israeli military told the New York Times that troops had shot back after being fired upon from the \"vicinity\" of the school. The Palestinian militant group Hamas -- which has fired more than 2,600 rockets against Israel and mounted raids inside Israel through a vast network of underground tunnels -- has stored rockets inside abandoned U.N. shelters and routinely mounts military strikes against Israelis from densely populated neighborhoods in Gaza.\n\nIt's unclear whether Wednesday's strike against a U.N. facility would mark a turning point in the conflict. But it is likely to massively increase pressure on Barack Obama's administration to negotiate an end to the weeks-long fighting, which shows no signs of winding down.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Bernadette Meehan said the administration is \"extremely concerned that thousands of internally displaced Palestinians who have been called on by the Israeli military to evacuate their homes are not safe in U.N.-designated shelters in Gaza.\" But Meehan also said armed Palestinians were \"responsible for hiding weapons in United Nations facilities in Gaza.\"\n\n\"This violence underscores the need to achieve a cease-fire as soon as possible,\" she added.\n\nState Department spokeswoman Marie Harf also condemned the shelling of the U.N. school. Asked whether she was not prepared to blame Israel for the attack, she said: \"That's correct. We have said that there needs to be a full investigation to see what happened here.\"\n\nBan said that the United Nations had provided Israeli military authorities with the precise location and coordinates of the shelter 17 times during the conflict, including a few hours before the attack. Ban's deputy secretary-general, Jan Eliasson, said that the United Nations found mortar fragments from Israeli shells at the scene of the strike that pointed to Israeli responsibility.\n\n\"They were aware of the coordinates and exact locations where these people are being sheltered,\" Ban said. \"I condemn this attack in the strongest possible terms.

On Wednesday, three Israeli soldiers were killed in what Israeli officials described as an operation in a booby-trapped UNRWA health clinic.\n\nThe U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) -- which is sheltering more than 200,000 Palestinians in some 85 locations -- has discovered rocket arsenals hidden in U.N.-administered schools. John Ging, a senior U.N. relief official, told reporters at U.N. headquarters Wednesday that the rockets were placed in schools abandoned by the United Nations during the conflict.\n\nLate Wednesday, Jordan, the lone Arab country on the Security Council, called for an emergency session Thursday morning to hear briefings on Gaza from the U.N.'s top humanitarian relief experts. Amman has also been weighing whether to push for a vote on a Security Council resolution condemning Israel's military operation and calling on the U.N. to protect Palestinian civilians. The United States has previously opposed the adoption of such a resolution, arguing that it would be more productive to persuade the warring parties to negotiate a cease-fire.\n\nAs the fighting persisted, U.S., U.N., and European diplomats intensified efforts to revive the stalled peace process, focusing on four key elements: an immediate cease-fire, a plan for reopening Gaza's border crossings into Egypt and Israel, the establishment of humanitarian aid corridors to bring in goods, and a proposal for disarming armed Palestinian groups.\n\nRobert Serry, the U.N. special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, is in the region pushing both parties to agree to the four measures. The cease-fire proposal that he's advocating is largely based on U.N. Security Council Resolution 1860, which sets the terms for Israel's withdrawal from Gaza following Operation Cast Lead, the 2008-2009 conflict between Israel and Hamas.

But some say the cycle of periodic bloodshed can be broken.\n\nA Palestinian girl combs through the rubble of the Gaza Strip's Shejaiya neighborhood on Friday. About 25 percent of Gaza's residents have been displaced from their homes in the current war with Israel.\n\nIn the battered Gaza neighborhood of Shejaiya, Ataf Ettish surveys what was once her home. An Israeli bomb ripped off the outside of the three-story building, exposing the blue and pink inner walls of her daughter's bedroom.\n\nThe building next door is gone, replaced by a crater, the 80-year-old owner buried beneath the rubble. Ms. Ettish now lives in a United Nations shelter, sharing a single toilet with 1,000 people.\n\n\"This is not a war \u2013 this is destruction of humanity,\" she says. \"I've lived through two previous wars here, but this is the worst.\"\n\nIn the Israeli kibbutz of Kfar Aza, just across the border but a world away, Mark Joffe agrees it's getting worse.\n\n\"Each time it happens ... the rockets are bigger, the threats are bigger,\" says Mr. Joffe, who says residents fear Hamas will infiltrate the border community (\"Aza\" is the Hebrew word for \"Gaza\"). \"If we'd done the right thing five to six years ago, it would have been a lot less costly.\"\n\nNow many Israelis' belief that an extended, harsh crackdown on Hamas will bring lasting peace is being put to the test. On Friday, a conflict that has cost 1,600 Palestinian lives and seen a quarter of Gaza's population displaced from their homes looked set to enter a dangerous new phase after an apparent Hamas capture of an Israeli soldier. Israel responded with withering bursts of artillery fire that claimed dozens more lives.\n\nOn both sides of the border, attitudes have hardened into a mixture of resignation and fury. Palestinians in Gaza see fighting Israel as their only hope of breaking an economic blockade. Israelis believe that all that can be done is to periodically \"mow the lawn\" - assaults designed to keep Hamas's military abilities at a manageable level. Yet Hamas has only grown stronger and more savvy with time - this operation has claimed 63 Israeli soldiers lives, against 10 in the last major conflict that ended in 2009.\n\nBut that would seem to guarantee flareups every few years. Is there a way to break the cycle of revenge and violence to the benefit of both Palestinians and Israelis?\n\nSome say yes. Sari Bashi, an Israeli who works on freedom of movement for Palestinians at Tel Aviv's GISHA advocacy group, argues that were Israel to reduce the economic isolation and help living conditions improve in Gaza, it would yield a peace dividend for both sides.\n\n\"Economic strangling is destabilizing,\" she says. \"If restrictions on the movement of civilians and civilian goods are lifted, in the wake of this fighting, then we have a chance, not just of delaying, but actually preventing the next round of violence.\"\n\nIsrael imposed a land, air, and sea blockade in 2007, after Hamas won a brief civil war with its secular rival, Fatah, after beating them at the polls the year before. The blockade on travel, imports, and exports, which Israel said was necessary to prevent militants from stockpiling weapons, delivered a hammer blow to Gaza's economy. Hamas circumvented it through tunnels under the Egyptian border, smuggling food and fuel that became a lifeline for civilians, but also bringing in advanced weaponry in preparation for the next round of fighting.\n\nThis conflict, now in its fourth week, has already lasted longer than \"Operation Cast Lead,\" which went on for three weeks in 2008-09. And its intensity has surpassed Israel's eight-day aerial bombardment of 2012. Both times, Hamas insisted the blockade be lifted, but failed to achieve its aim.\n\nIn 2012, Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, the organization Hamas sprung from, brokered a cease-fire that called for the blockade to be eased in exchange for calm. But while Israel did lift some restrictions on trade and fishing, they were reinstated within months, and travel remained tightly controlled.\n\nEconomic conditions deteriorated further last summer after Egypt's military overthrew Mr. Morsi and cracked down on the Brotherhood and Hamas, shutting the smuggling tunnels. Gaza prices for food, fuel and construction materials skyrocketed and water and electricity shortages became widespread. Unemployment rose to nearly 40 percent, a three-year high.\n\nHamas felt duped by the 2012 deal, and says that's why it is vowing to fight on until Israel and Egypt lift the blockade, a goal most Palestinians seem to support. \"Israel must know there is no security [for Israel] until there is security in Gaza,\" says Hamas official Musheer Al Masri.\n\nBut Israel is loath to give in to Hamas, an Islamist organization with political and military wings that vows in its founding charter to liberate all of historic Palestine and destroy Israel.\n\n\"At the end of the day, there is no Israeli government \u2013 left, right, up, or down \u2013 that is going to end this war with a cease-fire that's going to allow Hamas not only to declare victory but to prepare for an even deadlier war in the future,\" says Michael Oren, former Israeli ambassador to the US.\n\nIsraeli opinion has hardened since the previous two conflicts, with 5 million of the country's 8 million residents living under threat of a rocket strike, even though the US-funded Iron Dome system has prevented all but 3 civilian deaths in the current conflict. Polls show nearly 90 percent support among Jewish Israelis for the operation, with fewer than 4 percent saying the IDF has used excessive force.\n\nJoffe from Kfar Aza is firmly in the mainstream. When he moved here from Britain in the 1980s he was convinced that Israel should end its occupation of the Palestinian territories. But his views have changed.\n\n\"I've begun to sympathize with the view that if people are firing rockets at you and digging tunnels, you have to react \u2013 and react strongly enough that they won't do it again,\" he says, sitting in the nearly empty kibbutz as nearby Israeli artillery pounds northern Gaza.\n\nThe cease-fire that ended Israel's 2012 conflict with Hamas lasted only half as long as its 2009 predecessor. Joffe hadn't even gotten around to replacing his front door, pockmarked from shrapnel after 25 Katyushas hit his community in 2012, when a fresh volley of rockets started last month.\n\nHis reluctant conclusion as to why rocket fire resumed? \"We didn't react strongly enough before.\"\n\nYet Gaza analyst Mkhaimer Abu Saada says Israel is ignoring positive signals from Hamas.\n\nIn a 2012 CNN interview, Hamas political chief Khaled Meshaal said the group would \"resort to a peaceful way\" if Israel would agree to the creation of a Palestinian state. Hamas also agreed to a Palestinian unity government in June that Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said would recognize Israel, renounce violence, and abide by the Oslo Accords, which called for a demilitarized Palestinian state.\n\n\"To say Hamas doesn't want peace, Hamas wants to destroy Israel, the Hamas charter speaks about the destruction of Israel \u2013 that's not going to solve the problem,\" says Prof. Abu Saada. \"We know that Hamas is ... completely different from radical extremist groups, and it is ready to accept a settlement with Israel that would allow Palestinians to live in a state within the 1967 borders. But basically they cannot come forward now, and recognize Israel, without Israel recognizing the Palestinians.\"\n\nMany in Gaza see the current conflict as an outgrowth of Israel's refusal to negotiate for a Palestinian state. \"It's not an issue of Hamas or resistance. It's an issue of occupation,\" says Khaled Bedah, a retired professor waiting outside Gaza's main hospital for news of his nephew, who was wounded in an Israeli airstrike. The injured man's father, Suheil Bedah, nods his agreement.\n\nMore than 20 years after the 1993 Oslo Accords laid out a framework for a Palestinian state and an end to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza that began in 1967, Palestinians still have no state. Though Israel withdrew its settlers and troops from Gaza in 2005, it still controls the borders, airspace, and even telecommunications frequencies of both territories. The number of Israeli settlers in the West Bank has tripled since Oslo.\n\nThis may seem like a poor time to sow peace. But due to rising regional fears of Islamist extremists, it's actually an opportunity for Israel to ally with Sunni Arab states, says Gershon Baskin, who has facilitated backchannel negotiations between Israel and Hamas.\n\n\"We're at a unique opportunity today because for the first time in a long time the geopolitical reality in the region is that Israel has a lot of allies,\" he says.\n\nIf Israel were willing to engage with the Saudi-backed template for creating a Palestinian state, known as the Arab Peace Initiative, Arab countries could in turn help to stabilize and disarm Gaza, says Mr. Baskin.\n\nTo be sure, Israel has deep reservations about outsiders patrolling its own borders, and not without reason. United Nations troops stationed in the Sinai Peninsula after the 1956 Suez crisis famously capitulated to an Egyptian army command to get of the way at the start of the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.\n\nBut Yaron Ezrahi, professor emeritus of political science at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, says such concerns could be addressed by involving countries who share Israel's interest in disarming Hamas.\n\nHe sees Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, along with the US and Europe, as key partners in an international coalition. Under such an arrangement, the Palestinian Authority could take full control of the Gaza Strip, including the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, with international monitoring to prevent weapons smuggling.\n\nIndeed, the unity Palestinian Authority government agreed to by Hamas was intended to take over governance in Gaza.\n\nLifting the blockade on Gaza and moving toward a sovereign Palestinian state would remove much of the incentive for violence on the Palestinian side.\n\n\"As long as there is occupation, there will be resistance, whether it is Hamas or someone else,\" says Suheil Bedah, the father waiting outside the hospital for his injured son. \"But if Palestinians can take our rights, our needs, then all this would end.\"", "html": null, "created_at": 1407006280.361, "image": "http://www.csmonitor.com/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/content/2014/gaza2814/18804700-1-eng-US/gaza2814.jpg", "title": "What could be done to break the Israeli-Palestinian revenge cycle?", "feed_id": 10, "updated_at": 1418351668.920345, "source_id": 4, "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2014/0802/What-could-be-done-to-break-the-Israeli-Palestinian-revenge-cycle", "id": 10300}, {"text": "The possible capture of an Israeli soldier by Hamas has dialed up the intensity of the fight over Gaza.

A cease-fire between Israel and Hamas that ended a month of fighting is holding for a second day, ahead of negotiations in Cairo on a long-term truce and a broader deal for the war-ravaged Gaza Strip.\n\nAs Israel and Hamas sit down at indirect negotiations in Egypt aimed at delivering a lasting cease-fire in the Gaza conflict, both sides are out to get an agreement that is different from past accords.\n\nBut both sides wanting a different outcome than in the past is where any similarity between their aims comes to an abrupt halt. That's one reason why officials and regional experts say devising an arrangement that ends the month-long war in a lasting manner will be extremely difficult.\n\nWith both sides reluctant to return to fighting but with neither side ready to accept the other's chief demands, the outcome is likely to be a minimal agreement that risks leaving in place the conditions that have led to three rounds of fighting in five years, some analysts say.\n\n\"Right now I think these cease-fire talks should lead to a cessation of hostilities, but primarily because Israel and Hamas are not inclined to continue fighting,\" says Eric Trager, an expert on the Muslim Brotherhood in regional politics at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. The talks \"aren't going to get to what each really wants,\" he adds, which for Israel is verifiable control of what enters Gaza, and for Hamas, an end of the seven-year-old blockade on Gaza.\n\nWith the 72-hour cease-fire that began Tuesday morning about half over, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators were in Cairo Wednesday evening as calm held in Gaza and Israel. Israeli officials said the country is prepared to extend the cease-fire, which is set to expire Friday.\n\nIsrael is determined to secure an agreement that is different from others reached in the past in that it rules out any possibility of Hamas and the associated organization Palestinian Islamic Jihad rearming themselves. Israel wants guarantees of tight controls on what enters the small strip of land inhabited by 1.8 million Palestinians.\n\nBut Hamas says any settlement must end Israel's blockade \u2013 or what Hamas calls a \"siege\" \u2013 of the Gaza Strip. Israel and Egypt have enforced border closures since Hamas won elections and took control in Gaza in 2007, and provisions in past accords for easing the blockade were never fully implemented.\n\nThe polar-opposite nature of what each side wants out of the Cairo talks leaves many analysts dubious that something of a lasting nature can be achieved \u2013 no matter how damaging the recurring fighting has been to all sides.\n\n\"The alternative to a long-lasting cease-fire looks like some uncoordinated unilateralism by both Israel and Hamas \u2013 and that in the past has been a recipe for producing a high risk of escalation,\" says Nathan Brown, a senior associate in Middle East studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. \"For that reason, I expect that most actors will try to reach such a cease-fire,\" he adds, \"but the question is whether the incentives are strong enough in what will inevitably be a very complicated diplomatic context.\"\n\nHamas will resist disarming unless forced to do so \u2013 but the Israelis \"will not invest the force necessary to accomplish that goal,\" Dr. Brown says.

That's one reason why officials and regional experts say devising an arrangement that ends the month-long war in a lasting manner will be extremely difficult.\n\nWith both sides reluctant to return to fighting but with neither side ready to accept the other's chief demands, the outcome is likely to be a minimal agreement that risks leaving in place the conditions that have led to three rounds of fighting in five years, some analysts say.\n\n\"Right now I think these cease-fire talks should lead to a cessation of hostilities, but primarily because Israel and Hamas are not inclined to continue fighting,\" says Eric Trager, an expert on the Muslim Brotherhood in regional politics at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. The talks \"aren't going to get to what each really wants,\" he adds, which for Israel is verifiable control of what enters Gaza, and for Hamas, an end of the seven-year-old blockade on Gaza.\n\nWith the 72-hour cease-fire that began Tuesday morning about half over, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators were in Cairo Wednesday evening as calm held in Gaza and Israel. Israeli officials said the country is prepared to extend the cease-fire, which is set to expire Friday.\n\nIsrael is determined to secure an agreement that is different from others reached in the past in that it rules out any possibility of Hamas and the associated organization Palestinian Islamic Jihad rearming themselves. Israel wants guarantees of tight controls on what enters the small strip of land inhabited by 1.8 million Palestinians.\n\nBut Hamas says any settlement must end Israel's blockade \u2013 or what Hamas calls a \"siege\" \u2013 of the Gaza Strip. Israel and Egypt have enforced border closures since Hamas won elections and took control in Gaza in 2007, and provisions in past accords for easing the blockade were never fully implemented.\n\nThe polar-opposite nature of what each side wants out of the Cairo talks leaves many analysts dubious that something of a lasting nature can be achieved \u2013 no matter how damaging the recurring fighting has been to all sides.\n\n\"The alternative to a long-lasting cease-fire looks like some uncoordinated unilateralism by both Israel and Hamas \u2013 and that in the past has been a recipe for producing a high risk of escalation,\" says Nathan Brown, a senior associate in Middle East studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. \"For that reason, I expect that most actors will try to reach such a cease-fire,\" he adds, \"but the question is whether the incentives are strong enough in what will inevitably be a very complicated diplomatic context.\"\n\nHamas will resist disarming unless forced to do so \u2013 but the Israelis \"will not invest the force necessary to accomplish that goal,\" Dr. Brown says. On the other side of the coin, he adds, ending the blockade and opening up Gaza \"is very unlikely to happen except perhaps in a very limited way.\"\n\nDr. Brown's downbeat prognosis as a result: \"If there is a cease-fire, nobody will get much of what they want.\"\n\nWhat that means, says the Washington Institute's Mr. Trager, is that Israel will come out of the talks without the substantial border-monitoring mechanism it wants, and Hamas is unlikely to get the opening up of Gaza's seaport and airport, and extending fishing access of the coast of Gaza, that it seeks.\n\nSome diplomats in the region have speculated that the United Nations might be tapped to play a deeper role in Gaza in a way that would allow for something other than a minimalist cease-fire agreement.

There is no Iron Dome that can undo the images of suffering and destruction burned into our memories or justify away the damage to Israel's legitimacy that comes from such wanton slaughter. Most importantly, the Iron Dome protects Israel only from the damage others try to inflict upon it; it cannot save the country from the damage it does to itself.\n\nLet's accept for a moment every single argument made by the Israeli leadership for their actions in Gaza: Missile attacks are intolerable. Kidnapping and killing Israeli boys is a horror. Hamas is a terrorist group. It uses human shields to protect its munitions and its fighters. It actively invites Israeli attacks that inevitably wreak havoc upon innocent Palestinians. Every country has a right to defend itself. Other countries have done worse to protect the security of their citizens. It is easy to accept all these things. They are all true.\n\nAlso, let's set aside the counterarguments. Set aside the reality that this war was started as much as response to Israeli government anger over the Palestinian unity government as it was to address the security concerns above. Set aside that it was in part an emotional response to the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teens as it was to missile attacks. Set aside that these missile attacks launched from Hamas-controlled Gaza have inflicted relatively limited damage since they started over a decade ago and that Israel's response to these attacks has been -- by any measure -- disproportionate. These things may also be true, but there are counterarguments to the counterarguments.\n\nIf you were an Israeli and you had lost one relative, or watched your child huddle in a shelter through even just one missile attack, your concern would be the safety of your family. Further, it would be impossible to look at the threat posed by any individual attack or any series of attacks as being isolated or limited; greater risks still loomed. As Jeffrey Goldberg points out in his well-argued and thoughtful piece, \"What Would Hamas Do If It Could Do Whatever It Wanted?\" it is a fact that Hamas lists among its stated goals the destruction not only of Israel but of all Jews.\n\nAnd of course these counterarguments to the counterarguments are no less compelling than those of Gazans who feel that blockading 1.8 million people in a bleak urban environment is oppressive, and who have every right to demand the freedom, dignity, and personal security they are not receiving -- people who rightly feel that no matter what Hamas's tactics, there is nothing that justifies the killing of their children, not to mention their innocent sisters, brothers, mothers, and fathers.\n\nThat is the horrible reality of this situation. With an open mind, it is easy to see the perspectives of both sides. With an open heart, it is easy to understand the fear and the heartbreak and the impulse for survival that have pushed both groups to the desperate acts they have committed.\n\nBut if, in committing this show of egregious force, Israel's primary goal was to enhance its security, it likely achieved only near-term gains on that front. Hamas remains. The populace from which it recruits is inflamed. Its global funders in faraway places like Qatar remain safe and intact and no less inclined to write checks. Indeed, they have gained standing through this conflict and been invited to join the table in diplomatic exchanges where, had they not been funders of terrorism, they would have had no place.\n\nIf Israel's goal was to delegitimize Hamas, whatever it achieved during these last three weeks came at the expense of its own reputation. No matter how many articulate, pommy-accented spokespeople Israel rolls out to discuss human shields, they are trumped by the images of dead and wounded women and children, the stories of displaced families, the ground truth of an advanced, technologically sophisticated, militarily powerful nation laying waste to a land it occupies in order to root out a small cadre of fighters who pose little strategic threat to it. In short, Israel was waging a military action against an adversary that was waging a political campaign and thus adopted the wrong tactics and measured their progress by the wrong metrics. In fact, there is no denying that the Israeli tactics (it seems very unlikely there was any real strategizing going on) in this war do not pass the most basic tests available by which to assess them, those of morality, proportionality, and effectiveness.\n\nStrategically, this is about neither missiles nor tunnels. It is, at its heart, like most aspects of Israel's long struggle with the Palestinians, about the terms by which the people of Palestine will get the state that is theirs by every right and precept of international law and decency. Therefore, Israel's action has to be assessed in terms of whether or not it will help or hurt its own standing in that negotiation, in which both sides participate by virtue of their daily actions whether there's a formal negotiating table in place or not. And for all the reasons cited above, it can only hurt. Further, it must be asked whether the bloodshed in Gaza will make it more or less likely that the world will embrace Palestinian efforts to claim independence with or without Israeli cooperation. What is more, even if Hamas is weakened by the actions of the past few weeks, and the world (including perhaps Hamas) realizes the benefits of allowing the Palestinian Authority's current leaders to take the lead on behalf of the Palestinian people, that transfer to a more legitimate leadership takes away one of Israel's favorite excuses for not making progress toward an agreement.

Israel can rightly claim to have inflicted great damage on Hamas, destroying rockets and tunnel complexes and exposing their cowardly and reckless tactics for what they are. Hamas can claim to have won simply because they survived and will live to fight another day, in that instance with a new army of recruits inflamed into action by this last war.\n\nSuch claims aside, the reality is that it is almost certainly more true that both sides lost than it is that either won.

Ukrainian officials say the plane was targeted by separatist fighters using a surface-to-air missile, possibly with direct Russian aid. Dominique Faget/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Obama administration expanded its case Sunday accusing Ukrainian separatists and Russian forces of working hand in hand to acquire and operate a missile battery believed to have shot down a Malaysia Airlines jetliner last week, killing nearly 300 people.\n\nCiting an \"enormous amount of evidence,\" Secretary of State John F. Kerry accused Russia of providing SA-11 antiaircraft missiles to the pro-Russian rebels and training them how to fire the advanced weapons. He also said U.S. intelligence agencies \"saw the launch\" of a missile from rebel-held territory in eastern Ukraine and recorded its trajectory at the moment the passenger plane vanished from radar.\n\nMeanwhile, in Kiev, the U.S. Embassy said American intelligence analysts had confirmed the authenticity of recorded conversations in which rebel leaders bragged about shooting down what they thought was a Ukrainian military transport plane moments after the Malaysian jetliner was blown apart. The Ukrainian government had previously aired the audio excerpts, but the U.S. statement vouching for their reliability buttressed the charges against the rebels.\n\nThe fresh allegations came as armed separatists maintained tight control over the crash site in eastern Ukraine, preventing outside investigators from conducting an independent forensic examination of what caused the midair disaster.\n\nThree days after the crash, Ukrainian rebels moved the decomposing bodies of about 200 victims to refrigerated railway cars at a nearby train station but continued to haggle with their enemies in the Ukrainian government over what to do with the remains.\n\nTemperatures in eastern Ukraine have reached the mid-80s, and the bodies were rapidly decomposing in the fields and villages where they fell.\n\n\"The stench was absolutely overwhelming\" in the refrigerated trains, said Michael Bociurkiw, a spokesman for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has sent international observers to the site. \"I don't want to be too gruesome, but it's a very difficult scene to watch.\"\n\nBociurkiw said local officials and rebel representatives planned to leave the railway cars in place until international experts could inspect them and provide guidance.\n\n\"The thinking is that the cars should be taken to Ukrainian-controlled territory and they should be processed there,\" he said.\n\nA spokesman for the rebels, Sergey Kavtaradze, confirmed that the separatists had moved the bodies but said they were ready to hand the remains over to authorities in Kiev. \"Finally we've placed them in a train, and now we are waiting for the experts to come,\" he said. \"We're expecting Kiev to tell us where to take these bodies.\"\n\nThe rebels had come under withering criticism from officials in Kiev, Washington, Kuala Lumpur, The Hague and European capitals who claimed they had failed to show respect for the dead \u2014 most of whom were Dutch citizens, flying from Amsterdam to Malaysia \u2014 and failed to preserve the integrity of the crime scene. The separatists have denied shooting down the plane, suggesting that the Ukrainian government was probably responsible.\n\nOn Sunday, after days of chaos, the rebels sought to bring a measure of order to the crash site. As many as 800 people were drafted to comb the area for bodies and debris, according to Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman, who has been leading negotiations with the separatists. The search effort, however, remained under the direct control of the rebels, he said.\n\nSeparatists said they found two devices that they believe are the jetliner's black boxes, which could contain valuable flight information about the last moments of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. Kavtaradze, the rebel spokesman, said the devices were under the personal watch of leader Alexander Borodai.\n\n\"We have found the technical devices that potentially might be the black box,\" Kavtaradze said. \"Experts should determine this. We expect Malaysian experts to come today, and we will give the technical devices to them. We will not provide those things to the Ukrainian side.\"\n\nThe condition of the black boxes \u2014 and who ends up controlling them \u2014 could play a key role in the crash investigation.\n\nOn Sunday, the Ukrainian security service released audio recordings of what they said were rebel leaders talking on the phone two days earlier about the importance of keeping the black boxes out of the hands of international investigators.

Ukrainian officials say the plane was targeted by separatist fighters using a surface-to-air missile, possibly with direct Russian aid. Dominique Faget/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Obama administration expanded its case Sunday accusing Ukrainian separatists and Russian forces of working hand in hand to acquire and operate a missile battery believed to have shot down a Malaysia Airlines jetliner last week, killing nearly 300 people.\n\nCiting an \"enormous amount of evidence,\" Secretary of State John F. Kerry accused Russia of providing SA-11 antiaircraft missiles to the pro-Russian rebels and training them how to fire the advanced weapons. He also said U.S. intelligence agencies \"saw the launch\" of a missile from rebel-held territory in eastern Ukraine and recorded its trajectory at the moment the passenger plane vanished from radar.\n\nMeanwhile, in Kiev, the U.S. Embassy said American intelligence analysts had confirmed the authenticity of recorded conversations in which rebel leaders bragged about shooting down what they thought was a Ukrainian military transport plane moments after the Malaysian jetliner was blown apart. The Ukrainian government had previously aired the audio excerpts, but the U.S. statement vouching for their reliability buttressed the charges against the rebels.\n\nThe fresh allegations came as armed separatists maintained tight control over the crash site in eastern Ukraine, preventing outside investigators from conducting an independent forensic examination of what caused the midair disaster.\n\nThree days after the crash, Ukrainian rebels moved the decomposing bodies of about 200 victims to refrigerated railway cars at a nearby train station but continued to haggle with their enemies in the Ukrainian government over what to do with the remains.\n\nTemperatures in eastern Ukraine have reached the mid-80s, and the bodies were rapidly decomposing in the fields and villages where they fell.\n\n\"The stench was absolutely overwhelming\" in the refrigerated trains, said Michael Bociurkiw, a spokesman for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has sent international observers to the site. \"I don't want to be too gruesome, but it's a very difficult scene to watch.\"\n\nBociurkiw said local officials and rebel representatives planned to leave the railway cars in place until international experts could inspect them and provide guidance.\n\n\"The thinking is that the cars should be taken to Ukrainian-controlled territory and they should be processed there,\" he said.\n\nA spokesman for the rebels, Sergey Kavtaradze, confirmed that the separatists had moved the bodies but said they were ready to hand the remains over to authorities in Kiev. \"Finally we've placed them in a train, and now we are waiting for the experts to come,\" he said. \"We're expecting Kiev to tell us where to take these bodies.\"\n\nThe rebels had come under withering criticism from officials in Kiev, Washington, Kuala Lumpur, The Hague and European capitals who claimed they had failed to show respect for the dead \u2014 most of whom were Dutch citizens, flying from Amsterdam to Malaysia \u2014 and failed to preserve the integrity of the crime scene. The separatists have denied shooting down the plane, suggesting that the Ukrainian government was probably responsible.\n\nOn Sunday, after days of chaos, the rebels sought to bring a measure of order to the crash site. As many as 800 people were drafted to comb the area for bodies and debris, according to Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman, who has been leading negotiations with the separatists. The search effort, however, remained under the direct control of the rebels, he said.\n\nSeparatists said they found two devices that they believe are the jetliner's black boxes, which could contain valuable flight information about the last moments of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. Kavtaradze, the rebel spokesman, said the devices were under the personal watch of leader Alexander Borodai.\n\n\"We have found the technical devices that potentially might be the black box,\" Kavtaradze said. \"Experts should determine this. We expect Malaysian experts to come today, and we will give the technical devices to them. We will not provide those things to the Ukrainian side.\"\n\nThe condition of the black boxes \u2014 and who ends up controlling them \u2014 could play a key role in the crash investigation.\n\nOn Sunday, the Ukrainian security service released audio recordings of what they said were rebel leaders talking on the phone two days earlier about the importance of keeping the black boxes out of the hands of international investigators. According to the intercepted calls, whose authenticity could not be independently verified, a rebel commander issued orders at the behest of \"our high-placed friends\" in Moscow to maintain close watch over the boxes.\n\nU.S. and Ukrainian government officials have accused the rebels of destroying evidence, obstructing outside investigators and covering their tracks.

Last week, the Russian cabinet signed off on a measure that would increase Russian defense spending to 21 percent of the country's overall budget by 2017 from 17.5 today. The spending hike still needs to be stamped by the Duma, the Russian legislature, but is virtually certain to be approved.\n\nThe defense sector is a valuable tool in the Kremlin's foreign-policy playbook. Russia -- the world's second largest arms exporter -- has cornered the market by selling its weapons at bargain-basement prices and being willing to cut deals with all sorts of unsavory regimes. Moscow has not shied away from using its arms industry to bolster Russia's allies, from supplying Syria with advanced radar systems and S-300 surface-to-air missile systems, selling weapons to Iran, and arming Ukrainian rebels with the types of missiles used to down Malaysia Airlines Flight MH 17 this earlier this month.\n\nStill, last week's announcement marks a shift for Russia's defense industry, which has been trying to sell more of its wares to the Russian armed forces than to foreign buyers. The industry is making the move in response to clear pressure from the Kremlin. In May, President Vladimir Putin called on Russia's defense industry to stop relying on foreign components following initial sanctions leveled by the United States and Europe. Since then, Western powers have since increased their punitive economic measures against Russia, including a recent round of American sanctions that targeted eight Russian defense firms. On Tuesday, European foreign ministers convened to consider further moves on Russia, including measures to restrict access to defense technology, but failed to reach agreement.\n\nThe outcome of the EU's decision will affect the Kremlin's plan to restructure the armed forces and replace the military's aging weaponry with new, modern equipment like the Su-35 jet and S-400 Triumph surface-to-air missile system. This ambitious $720 billion project -- launched in 2011 -- has already led to major increases in the defense budget. The Stockholm International Peace and Research Institute estimates that military spending increased by 4.8 percent in 2013 and that Russia spends a larger portion of its GDP on the military than the United States, where defense outlays total 4.1 percent of GDP (the disparity is even sharper with NATO, only four of whose 28 members spend 2 percent of GDP on defense).\n\nAccording to the Kremlin's official numbers, the military budget will continue to rise, reaching approximately $83.7 billion in 2015 and $93.9 billion in 2016. By comparison, the U.S. Department of Defense's budget proposal for 2015 totals $601 billion.\n\nOne of the aims of Russia's modernization plan is to produce more sophisticated weaponry within Russia. But shifting high-tech production to within Russian borders faces major obstacles, according to defense analysts. Russian defense companies like Irkut and Almaz-Antey have been able to develop new and efficient designs, while remaining profitable. But even these companies remain dependent on defense subcontractors abroad, such as parts for aircraft engines and missiles in Ukraine, for their supply chains. Meanwhile, Russian alternatives are lacking in technical ability.\n\nMoscow's attempts to revitalize its shipbuilding industry have not gone smoothly. In 2005, India inked a nearly $1 billion deal with Russia for a rebuilt Soviet-era aircraft carrier -- called Vikramaditya. However, the ship suffered a near-total breakdown shortly after her purported completion in 2012. India finally accepted Vikramaditya in 2014, though the refurbishment nearly tripled the project's cost to $2.3 billion. If Russia can't even remodel an existing warship, imagine the challenges the defense sector faces in building a ship from scratch.\n\nAnd the fallout from the Ukraine crisis has only exacerbated Russia's reliance on foreign technology. Russia is currently awaiting delivery of a pair of Mistral helicopter carrier ships from France, a contract valued at $1.6 billion that promises to help modernize Russia's geriatric navy. While French President Francois Hollande has pledged to complete delivery of on the first ship, he has indicated a willingness to scrap plans for the sale of the second if E.U. nations increase sanctions against Russia.\n\nAccording to a study released in April by the Plekhanov Russian University of Economics, the buildings and equipment of Russian industrial enterprises are on average more than 20 years old, with a level of wear and tear almost twice that of industries in other BRICS countries. For the defense sector to be able to meet the demands of the military's ambitions, the defense sector will need a complete infrastructure overhaul.\n\n\"Russia needs European countries to cooperate with it so that it can get a better technical capability,\" Siemon Wezeman, a senior researcher for the Stockholm International Peace and Research Institute, said. \"The Russian defense industry is certainly capable of designing some complex systems, but they are not prepared to produce these on their own,\" adds Wezeman.\n\nGrowing domestic production is representative of Russia's increasingly inward-looking posture on the world stage, but there are serious doubts over whether Russia will be able to afford its defense aspirations. \"Two years ago it was possible to fund this rise in spending because of the oil and gas industry,\" said Igor Sutyagin, a Research Fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London. \"Now, because of sanctions, stagnation, and new expenses from Crimea and Ukraine, building up the military as planned is completely unsustainable.\"\n\nEvents in Georgia in 2008 and Crimea this March have shown that Russia is more than eager to use its updated military to settle disputes.

This perspective argues that Russia's schism with the US will keep on widening no matter what happens in Ukraine.\n\nThe US, they say, is pursuing a \"containment 2.0\" strategy that, like the successful US cold war policy that toppled the former Soviet Union, is aimed at weakening and ultimately defeating Russia as a geopolitical foe.\n\nSeveral waves of sanctions have hit banks and individuals considered close to President Putin or heavily involved in Russia's Ukraine policy-making. Last week the US imposed the toughest measures yet, curbing the access of leading Russian banks and oil companies to Western capital markets. The European Union followed up with somewhat milder sanctions, which they have threatened to bolster again in the wake of the MH17 disaster.\n\nBut while Moscow's March annexation of Crimea may have been the trigger that unleashed successive waves of sanctions from the US and Europe, the \"containment 2.0\" theory's adherents say that it was merely the spark that set off a conflict that had been brewing for a long time.\n\n\"It's an illusion to believe that there are some specific steps we could take in connection with Ukraine to mollify the US, and they would lift this blockade and return to normal,\" says Sergei Markov, a Kremlin-connected political analyst. \"No, just watch, they will keep moving the goal posts.\"\n\nThe real reasons that US-Russia acrimony has been inexorably building, they say, is that Russia is at the leading edge of emerging countries that are challenging the US-run global financial and political order.\n\nThe US plan, Mr. Markov says, \"is to continue tightening the screws over the long term, aiming to increase discontent among Russia's middle class, and to turn people against Putin. The ultimate goal is regime change, and we would be fools not to see that.\"\n\nAlthough the Kremlin has claimed that sanctions against Russia will \"boomerang\" against Western economic interests, few analysts believe Russia can win against the overwhelming financial and economic firepower of the US and its allies in any extended showdown. As such, some argue that Russia has no choice but to accept a measure of isolation as its lot.\n\nBut there are ways Russia can turn the situation to its advantage, they say.\n\nFirst, they argue, the Kremlin could adopt policies that might compensate for the loss of foreign investment by encouraging domestic capital to mobilize.\n\nIndeed, they say, something just like that appears to have happened by accident. After the first wave of US sanctions caused an exodus of foreign investors in March, a remarkable Russian stock market rebound occurred in the weeks after, as Russians came rushing in to snap up the bargains.\n\nSimilarly, they argue, the Russian government can use its nearly half-a-trillion dollars in foreign currency reserves to bolster the ruble and back investments in domestic industries. That could make up for the coming loss of virtually all Ukrainian imports and redirect Russia's economy from raw materials exports to modern manufacturing and services.\n\n\"There is a lot of domestic capital and energy that could be unlocked, but our elites need to embrace reforms,\" says Sergei Karaganov, honorary chair of the Council on Foreign and Defense Policies, a leading Moscow think tank. \"The sanctions so far imposed are doing very little harm, but our economy was stagnating even before,\" due to over reliance on raw materials exports and an unwelcoming environment for small and medium-sized businesses in Russia.\n\n\"The sanctions can be an impetus, a wake-up call,\" he says, \"but only if we make the right policy choices.\"\n\nThe other major thing Russia can do, say those who see a US campaign against it, is grow its ties with like-thinking countries who are also at odds with the US-dominated world order.\n\nUnlike the former Soviet Union, whose string of client states were a crippling economic drain, Russia's potential allies are some of the world's fastest-growing economies. Two months ago Putin closed a huge gas deal with China, signalling that Moscow has alternatives if its main customer, the EU, decides to stop buying Russian energy. Last week, at a summit of the BRICS [Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa] countries, the emerging five-nation group resoundingly condemned US-led sanctions against Russia. They also established a development bank which could eventually rival US-dominated institutions such as the World Bank.\n\nThe evolution of the BRICS over the past 14 years from an idea suggested by a Goldman Sachs analyst to an actual bloc of countries that holds summits, coordinates foreign policies, and designs its own supra-national institutions obviously has deeply-rooted causes. But Russian experts say the current sanctions campaign against Russia by the US is probably doing more than anything else to spur the determination of BRICS states to develop their own parallel institutions \u2013 and, incidentally, give refuge to Russia.\n\n\"A couple of years ago the idea of a BRICS development bank seemed completely fanciful,\" says Georgi Toloraya, director of the Russian National Committee for BRICS Research, a semi-official think tank in Moscow. \"But now we have this confrontation between Russia and the West. Tensions are growing between China and the US in the political-military sphere. This is changing minds rapidly. Now the idea of creating a separate institution doesn't seem so exotic at all.\"", "html": null, "created_at": 1406164774.555999, "image": "http://www.csmonitor.com/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/content/2014/0723-ochasm/18762721-1-eng-US/0723-ochasm.jpg", "title": "Is US bent on bringing down Russia?

The European Union followed up with somewhat milder sanctions, which they have threatened to bolster again in the wake of the MH17 disaster.\n\nBut while Moscow's March annexation of Crimea may have been the trigger that unleashed successive waves of sanctions from the US and Europe, the \"containment 2.0\" theory's adherents say that it was merely the spark that set off a conflict that had been brewing for a long time.\n\n\"It's an illusion to believe that there are some specific steps we could take in connection with Ukraine to mollify the US, and they would lift this blockade and return to normal,\" says Sergei Markov, a Kremlin-connected political analyst. \"No, just watch, they will keep moving the goal posts.\"\n\nThe real reasons that US-Russia acrimony has been inexorably building, they say, is that Russia is at the leading edge of emerging countries that are challenging the US-run global financial and political order.\n\nThe US plan, Mr. Markov says, \"is to continue tightening the screws over the long term, aiming to increase discontent among Russia's middle class, and to turn people against Putin. The ultimate goal is regime change, and we would be fools not to see that.\"\n\nAlthough the Kremlin has claimed that sanctions against Russia will \"boomerang\" against Western economic interests, few analysts believe Russia can win against the overwhelming financial and economic firepower of the US and its allies in any extended showdown. As such, some argue that Russia has no choice but to accept a measure of isolation as its lot.\n\nBut there are ways Russia can turn the situation to its advantage, they say.\n\nFirst, they argue, the Kremlin could adopt policies that might compensate for the loss of foreign investment by encouraging domestic capital to mobilize.\n\nIndeed, they say, something just like that appears to have happened by accident. After the first wave of US sanctions caused an exodus of foreign investors in March, a remarkable Russian stock market rebound occurred in the weeks after, as Russians came rushing in to snap up the bargains.\n\nSimilarly, they argue, the Russian government can use its nearly half-a-trillion dollars in foreign currency reserves to bolster the ruble and back investments in domestic industries. That could make up for the coming loss of virtually all Ukrainian imports and redirect Russia's economy from raw materials exports to modern manufacturing and services.\n\n\"There is a lot of domestic capital and energy that could be unlocked, but our elites need to embrace reforms,\" says Sergei Karaganov, honorary chair of the Council on Foreign and Defense Policies, a leading Moscow think tank. \"The sanctions so far imposed are doing very little harm, but our economy was stagnating even before,\" due to over reliance on raw materials exports and an unwelcoming environment for small and medium-sized businesses in Russia.\n\n\"The sanctions can be an impetus, a wake-up call,\" he says, \"but only if we make the right policy choices.\"\n\nThe other major thing Russia can do, say those who see a US campaign against it, is grow its ties with like-thinking countries who are also at odds with the US-dominated world order.\n\nUnlike the former Soviet Union, whose string of client states were a crippling economic drain, Russia's potential allies are some of the world's fastest-growing economies. Two months ago Putin closed a huge gas deal with China, signalling that Moscow has alternatives if its main customer, the EU, decides to stop buying Russian energy. Last week, at a summit of the BRICS [Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa] countries, the emerging five-nation group resoundingly condemned US-led sanctions against Russia. They also established a development bank which could eventually rival US-dominated institutions such as the World Bank.\n\nThe evolution of the BRICS over the past 14 years from an idea suggested by a Goldman Sachs analyst to an actual bloc of countries that holds summits, coordinates foreign policies, and designs its own supra-national institutions obviously has deeply-rooted causes. But Russian experts say the current sanctions campaign against Russia by the US is probably doing more than anything else to spur the determination of BRICS states to develop their own parallel institutions \u2013 and, incidentally, give refuge to Russia.\n\n\"A couple of years ago the idea of a BRICS development bank seemed completely fanciful,\" says Georgi Toloraya, director of the Russian National Committee for BRICS Research, a semi-official think tank in Moscow. \"But now we have this confrontation between Russia and the West. Tensions are growing between China and the US in the political-military sphere. This is changing minds rapidly. Now the idea of creating a separate institution doesn't seem so exotic at all.\"", "html": null, "created_at": 1406174652.825, "image": "http://www.csmonitor.com/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/content/2014/0723-ochasm/18762721-1-eng-US/0723-ochasm.jpg", "title": "Is US bent on bringing down Russia?

He said parliament could no longer do its work and pass necessary laws, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe nationalist Svoboda party and the Udar party led by former boxer Vitali Klitschko pulled out of the coalition. Speaker Oleksandr Turchynov said it was up to those parties to propose a candidate for temporary prime minister to lead the government until early parliamentary elections can be held.\n\nMeanwhile, artillery explosions could be heard around Donetsk on Thursday, a day after separatists fighting the Kiev government claimed responsibility for shooting down two warplanes near where a passenger airliner crashed last week after being struck by a missile. The most intense fighting appeared to be coming from a contested area near the city's airport. Despite the clashes, Australia's leader said Thursday that he was readying a policing team of 50 officers who he hopes will join an eventual United Nations mission to secure the airliner's crash site, which is 40 about miles east of Donetsk.\n\nThe attack on the warplanes came just six days after the Malaysia Airlines disaster, which has drawn international outrage and showcased the advanced firepower that apparently is available on the ground in the region. The Ukrainian military said Wednesday that the two Sukhoi Su-25 strike aircraft were flying at nearly 17,000 feet \u2014 an altitude that is out of the reach of the shoulder-fired missiles that the rebels said they had used to down the jets. Neither the government's nor the rebels' claims could be verified.\n\nUkraine has accused Russia of supplying fresh firepower to rebels over the porous border between the two countries in recent days, even as international attention has focused on a possible Russian role in the attack on Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. Although the details of Wednesday's incident remained unclear, it was a sign that the rebels may still be able to inflict significant damage on the Ukrainian military, whose major advantage over its rivals is in the air.\n\nCountries whose citizens were among the 298 people killed in the crash of Flight 17 began to discuss how to secure and investigate the debris site, which has been left almost completely unguarded in recent days.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Thursday that he has sent 50 police officers to London to prepare for a potential U.N. mission that would deploy at the final resting place of the Boeing 777.\n\n\"We are ready to deploy Australian police to Ukraine to help secure the site as part of an international team under United Nations authority,\" Abbott said in Canberra, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe pilots of the two Su-25 jets, which were among four planes that were fired upon as they were returning from a mission near the Russian border, are thought to have bailed out over rebel-held territory. Their conditions and whereabouts were unknown, and both the rebels and the government said they had initiated search missions.\n\n\"We shot them down with MANPADS,\" said rebel spokesman Sergey Kavtaradze, referring to shoulder-fired missiles that can reach a limited altitude.\n\nAndriy Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kiev that the planes were flying too high to be hit by such a weapon.\n\n\"It can be reached only by heavy missile complexes,\" he said.\n\nLysenko alleged that the missiles that hit the two planes were fired from Russian territory.\n\n\"They were shot down very professionally. The terrorists do not have such professionals,\" he said in reference to the pro-Russian rebels.\n\nPhotos that have emerged since the Flight 17 crash last Thursday suggest that Buk missile launchers that apparently were in the rebels' possession \u2014 and one of which Ukraine said was used to down the jetliner \u2014 have been transported to Russia. But U.S. officials have said that tanks, rocket launchers and other arms continue to flow into Ukraine from Russia.\n\nThe warplanes were shot down as the first 40 bodies of Flight 17 victims were en route to the Netherlands, where they are to be identified through DNA testing.\n\nThe Wednesday crashes in the vicinity of the Flight 17 site \u2014 about 25 miles south of its perimeter \u2014 provided an eerie reminder that the international shock over a missile strike on a passenger airliner has done little to deter the rebels from continuing to shoot down aircraft. It may even have given them some latitude, because commercial airliners now avoid flight paths over eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe Ukrainian military, which says it is observing a cease-fire within a 25-mile radius of the Flight 17 crash site, is engaged in an operation to squeeze separatists out of the towns and villages encircling their stronghold of Donetsk.\n\nMilitary officials say rebel forces are abandoning positions on the outskirts of Donetsk and regrouping in the city's center.\n\nA top rebel leader dismissed the retreat's significance. \"It's a tactical retreat,\" Pavel Gubarev told Russian state-run Rossiya 24 television. \"It was all planned.

It's normal military tactics.\"\n\nThe government claims to have regained control of several cities in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, where the separatists rose up in April and established \"people's republics,\" appointing new mayors and officials.\n\nUkraine's anti-terrorism operation, as the government calls its military campaign against the separatists, said Wednesday that it had \"liberated\" the towns of Karlivka, Netaylovo and Pervomayske near Donetsk. It said the Ukrainian flag is flying again in the towns, \"as a symbol of peace returning to these places.\"\n\nAleksey Dmitrashkovsky, a spokesman for the Ukrainian military, said that in the city of Kramatorsk, also in the Donetsk region, separatists are shedding their uniforms and dressing as taxi drivers and market vendors.

On Monday, however, the investigators were forced to turn back for a second day after hearing explosions and being warned of heavy combat in the area, where the Ukrainian military claimed significant advances against rebels.\n\nAgreement on the sanctions followed a five-way video conference call between President Obama and his counterparts from Britain, France, Germany and Italy \u2014 all of whom separately indicated they would support additional measures against Russia. European Union ambassadors are scheduled to meet Tuesday in Brussels to consider an arms embargo and sanctions against portions of the financial and energy sectors.\n\nWhile agreement from leaders of Europe's four leading governments was seen as a major step forward, it remains unclear whether all 28 EU members \u2014 who operate on the basis of consensus \u2014 will support a new sanctions package drawn up late last week.\n\nAll had agreed to ready the package, to be imposed if there was evidence that Russia was expanding rather than withdrawing its support for the separatists.\n\nOn Sunday, the United States published overhead surveillance photographs it said proved that Russia was continuing to supply weapons and fire artillery from its own territory into Ukraine. Russia has also increased deployment of its forces along the Ukrainian border in possible preparation for a \"so-called humanitarian or peacekeeping intervention in Ukraine,\" Blinken said.\n\n\"The latest information,\" a spokesman for British Prime Minister David Cameron said, is that \"Russia continues to transfer weapons across the border and to provide practical support to the separatists. Leaders agreed that the international community should therefore impose further costs on Russia, and specifically...a strong package of sectoral sanctions as swiftly as possible.\"\n\nThe administration has said it recognizes that Europe, with far larger economic relations with Russia, has more to lose than the United States. The new European sanctions package, while painful, has been carefully drawn to impose as little disruption as possible. An arms embargo would apply only to new contracts, a senior European diplomat said, allowing at least part of a massive French military shipbuilding contract to proceed.\n\nBut the downing of the airliner, and Moscow's refusal to yield in the face of previous sanctions, has strengthened the U.S. case that Europe must act.\n\nBlinken, who spoke to reporters in the White House briefing room, said that Russian support for the separatists had increased as they lost ground.\n\nUkrainian forces on Monday said they had captured the separatist stronghold of Saur Mogila, where two Ukrainian planes were shot down last week. A military spokesman characterized the army's success there as a major victory, since it simultaneously blocks a supply route for rebels from Russia, opens a corridor for Ukraine to resupply its own troops and gives the military control of mountaintop positions used to fire on government troops.\n\nThe Ukrainian army is fighting in a circle around the crash site, with the aim of ousting the rebels from the area, military spokesman Andriy Lysenko told reporters Monday in Kiev. \"We will force them to leave the site.\"\n\nThe fighting in Ukraine on Monday appeared to be taking place well within the 25-mile zone around the crash site that President Petro Poroshenko vowed troops would not fight or shell, but Lysenko claimed that the Ukrainian military was not conducting operations there.\n\nChunks of debris from the downed airliner, and possibly human remains, are still spread around the countryside and villages in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe continued difficulties in accessing the site appeared to be frustrating international observers on Monday.\n\n\"There's a job to be done,\" said Alexander Hug, the deputy head of a monitoring team from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Associated Press reported. \"We are sick and tired of being interrupted by gunfights, despite the fact that we have agreed that there should be a cease-fire.\"\n\nLysenko said experts analyzing the flight data recorders from the plane have turned up findings that the plane experienced a \"massive explosion, decompression\" consistent with being struck by a missile. Investigators in the Netherlands and Britain, however, have not said anything publicly about the contents of the recorders other than that they have begun to listen to them. If the plane was downed because of a missile, not mechanical failure, the recorders may not yield much useful information.\n\nAlso Monday, the United Nations top human rights official said the shootdown of the plane, with 298 passengers and crew aboard, \"may amount to a war crime.\"\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that it would be a grave mistake for the United States and Europe to send military aid to Ukraine, as some U.S. lawmakers have urged.\n\n\"Seeing how the Ukrainian authorities have been trying to resolve the so-called problem of the Southeast, I think such decisions would directly add oil to the fire and would ignite the belligerent and uncompromising instincts of Ukrainian leaders,\" Lavrov told reporters in Moscow.\n\nHe called for a U.N.-sponsored inquiry into the fate of the downed Malaysian airliner, and he again rejected U.S. and Ukrainian accusations that Russia was funneling weapons to rebels across the border and shelling Ukrainian military positions from the Russian side.\n\nA top rebel leader, Vladimir Antyufeev, blamed the Ukrainian government Monday for hampering international access to the plane's debris site, saying that the military was attacking rebel positions in the area and making it impossible for international investigators to make the journey from the Donetsk, about 40 miles to the west.\n\n\"Due to the continuation of the situation, they're in Donetsk,\" Antyufeev told journalists in that city Monday.\n\nIn a possible sign of stresses on rebel leadership, Antyufeev also announced that he was becoming the acting head of the Donetsk rebels after Alexander Borodai, another top leader, left for Moscow for consultations with unnamed individuals. Although Borodai, a Russian citizen and former resident of Moscow, has previously traveled to the Russian capital on rebel business, no handover of power has been made public, and it was unclear whether Borodai would be returning.\n\nMorello reported from Kiev.

We have to enter the territory, avoiding any provocation.\"\n\nAsked who was responsible for the team's inability to reach the site, Groysman placed the blame on the pro-Russian insurgents.\n\n\"As to who is putting obstacles in the way, it is terrorists, separatists, criminals doing everything in order to delay the process of entering the area,\" Groysman said.\n\nApakan was careful in choosing his words when asked who was responsible.\n\n\"We are doing the best we can,\" he said. \"There should be no fighting at all at the crash site. We are talking with all parties.\"\n\nThe impasse persisted a day after the White House said it expects Europe to adopt significant new sanctions against Russia this week, including against key economic sectors that the Europeans have resisted targeting in the past.\n\n\"In turn and in full coordination with Europe, the United States will implement additional measures itself\" amid growing evidence that Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin is \"doubling down\" on his efforts to support separatists battling the government in eastern Ukraine, deputy national security adviser Antony Blinken said.\n\nThe West has said Flight 17 was downed with a Russian-supplied missile fired from separatist territory, and investigators hope to make it to the site before evidence is destroyed.\n\nAgreement on the sanctions followed a five-way videoconference among President Obama and his counterparts from Britain, France, Germany and Italy \u2014 all of whom separately indicated that they would support additional measures against Russia. European Union ambassadors are scheduled to meet Tuesday in Brussels to consider an arms embargo and sanctions against portions of Russia's financial and energy sectors.\n\nWhile agreement from leaders of Europe's four leading governments was seen as a major step forward, it is unclear whether all 28 E.U. members \u2014 which operate on the basis of consensus \u2014 will support the new sanctions package, drawn up late last week.\n\nAll had agreed to ready the package, to be imposed if there was evidence that Russia was expanding rather than withdrawing its support for the separatists.\n\nOn Sunday, the United States published overhead surveillance photographs it said proved that Russia was continuing to supply weapons and to fire artillery from its own territory into Ukraine. Russia has also increased deployment of its forces along the Ukrainian border in possible preparation for a \"so-called humanitarian or peacekeeping intervention in Ukraine,\" Blinken said.\n\n\"The latest information,\" a spokesman for British Prime Minister David Cameron said, is that \"Russia continues to transfer weapons across the border and to provide practical support to the separatists. Leaders agreed that the international community should therefore impose further costs on Russia, and specifically . . . a strong package of sectoral sanctions as swiftly as possible.\"\n\nThe Obama administration has said it recognizes that Europe, with far larger economic relations with Russia, has more to lose than the United States. The new European sanctions package, while painful, has been carefully drawn to cause as little disruption as possible. An arms embargo would apply only to new contracts, a senior European diplomat said, allowing at least part of a massive French military shipbuilding contract to proceed.\n\nBut the downing of the airliner, and Moscow's refusal to yield in the face of previous sanctions, have strengthened the U.S. case that Europe must act.\n\nBlinken, who spoke to reporters in the White House briefing room, said Russian support for the separatists has increased as they have lost ground.\n\nUkrainian forces said Monday that they had captured the separatist stronghold of Saur Mogila, where two Ukrainian planes were shot down last week. A military spokesman characterized the army's success there as a major victory, since it simultaneously blocks a supply route for rebels from Russia, opens a corridor for Ukraine to resupply its own troops and gives the military control of mountaintop positions used to fire on government forces.\n\nThe Ukrainian army is fighting in a circle around the crash site, with the aim of ousting the rebels from the area, military spokesman Andriy Lysenko told reporters Monday in Kiev. \"We will force them to leave the site.\"\n\nLysenko said experts analyzing the flight data recorders from the plane have turned up findings showing that the aircraft experienced a \"massive explosion, decompression\" consistent with being struck by a missile. Investigators in the Netherlands and Britain, however, have not said anything publicly about the contents of the recorders other than that they have begun to listen to them. If the plane went down because of a missile, not a mechanical failure, the recorders may not yield much useful information.\n\nAlso Monday, the top U.N. human rights official said the shoot-down of the plane, with 298 passengers and crew members aboard, \"may amount to a war crime.\"\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said it would be a grave mistake for the United States and Europe to send military aid to Ukraine, as some U.S. lawmakers have urged.\n\n\"Seeing how the Ukrainian authorities have been trying to resolve the so-called problem of the southeast, I think such decisions would directly add oil to the fire and would ignite the belligerent and uncompromising instincts of Ukrainian leaders,\" Lavrov told reporters in Moscow.\n\nHe called for a U.N.-sponsored inquiry into the fate of the downed Malaysian airliner, and he again rejected U.S. and Ukrainian accusations that Russia is funneling weapons to rebels across the border and shelling Ukrainian military positions from the Russian side.\n\nA top rebel leader, Vladimir Antyufeev, blamed the Ukrainian government Monday for hampering international access to the plane's debris site, saying the military was attacking rebel positions in the area and making it impossible for international investigators to make the journey from Donetsk.\n\nIn a possible sign of stresses on rebel leadership, Antyufeev also announced that he was becoming the acting head of the Donetsk rebels after Alexander Borodai, another leader, left for Moscow for consultations with unnamed individuals. Although Borodai, a Russian citizen and former resident of Moscow, has previously traveled to the Russian capital on rebel business, and no handover of power has been made public, it was unclear whether Borodai would be returning.", "html": null, "created_at": 1406656102.0, "image": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-2048x1024.jpg", "title": "Clashes again force investigators to abort visit to Malaysia Airlines crash site", "feed_id": 14, "updated_at": 1418344660.01934, "source_id": 5, "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636708/s/3cf9f647/sc/11/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cworld0Ceurope0Cclashes0Eagain0Eforce0Einvestigators0Eto0Eabort0Evisit0Eto0Emalaysia0Eairlines0Ecrash0Esite0C20A140C0A70C290C91d0A99940E17220E11e40E9e3b0E7f2f110Ac62650Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Iworld/story01.htm", "id": 7486}], "story_id": 8, "created_at": 1406589180.0}, {"articles": [{"text": "President Obama and four other western leaders agree to tougher sanctions on Russia.

The New York Times newspaper reported in January that Washington informed its NATO partners that Russia had tested a ground-launched cruise missile. The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, ratified in 1988, was designed to eliminate ground-launched cruise missiles with ranges of 500 to 5,500km. State Department officials had hinted that a formal determination that Russia had violated the treaty could be forthcoming, said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, a Washington-based research and advocacy group. He said the violation would not represent a new military threat to the US and its European allies, given Russia's existing missile arsenal. But in an interview, Kimball called the infraction \"disturbing\". \"It suggests that Russia is moving away from a long US-Russia tradition of restraining the most dangerous weapons even as they have serious disagreements on all sorts of issues,\" he said. The United States notified Russia of its determination and called for senior-level talks \"with the aim of assuring the United States that Russia will come back into compliance\" with the treaty. \"The United States will, of course, consult with allies on this matter to take into account the impact of this Russian violation on our collective security if Russia does not return to compliance,\" the official said.", "html": null, "created_at": 1406658701.0, "image": "http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/images/2014/7/29//2014729143032343734_20.jpg", "title": "US: Russia violated nuclear missile treaty", "feed_id": 58, "updated_at": 1406658701.0, "source_id": 15, "url": "http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2014/07/us-russia-violated-nuclear-missile-treaty-2014729131726862847.html", "id": 7525}], "story_id": 8, "created_at": 1406619197.0}, {"articles": [{"text": "White House Threatens More Russia Sanctions, As Kerry Decries Rebels In Ukraine\n\nSaying that the conflict in Ukraine had \"gone on for far too long,\" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called on Russia to use its \"considerable influence\" to make sure investigators had access to the debris field of the downed Malaysia Airlines plane in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe separatists who control that area of Ukraine, said Kerry, \"have displayed an appalling disregard for human decency.\"\n\nThe secretary of state spoke after Dutch and Australian experts abandoned their attempts for a third day in a row to reach the debris field.\n\nCNN reports that the 50-member team was accompanied by monitors from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, who were unable to leave the Ukrainian city of Donetsk because \"there is too much fighting at the moment on and near the route to the disaster site.\"\n\nKerry also spoke after the European Union agreed to implement tougher sanctions against Russia.\n\nReuters says the deal reached by the EU on Tuesday targets the Russian \"oil industry, defense, dual-use goods and sensitive technologies.\"\n\n\"Among the new measures that were discussed are steps that could limit access of Russian banks to European capital markets, which could affect European holders of Russian debt and financial services firms that do business there,\" Reuters reports.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House said the U.S. also could unveil additional sanctions against Russia as early as today.\n\n\"It's precisely because we've not yet seen a strategic turn from Putin that we believe it's absolutely essential to take additional measures, and that's what the Europeans and the United States intend to do this week,\" Tony Blinken, Obama's deputy national security adviser, told The Associated Press earlier Tuesday.\n\nKerry, who was speaking alongside the Ukrainian foreign minister in Washington, said he had talked to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who told him Russia wanted to de-escalate the situation in Ukraine.\n\nHowever, Kerry said, actions have not shown \"a shred of evidence\" that Russia wants to end the violence.\n\nRussia Today, the Russian-funded, English-language news service, reports that Lavrov blamed Kiev.

That giant asteroid (or comet) had accomplices.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov speaks during a news conference in Moscow on Monday. Russia will not impose tit-for-tat measures over new Western sanctions, Mr. Lavrov said.\n\nMoscow is bracing for a new round of sanctions from the European Union and the US, which for the first time will strike at key Russian businesses like finance, energy, and arms. Some Western commentary suggests that these measures will hit Russia hard, and possibly undermine President Vladimir Putin's power base.\n\nBut most Russian experts are not so sure.\n\nThey argue that the direct economic consequences will prove manageable \u2013 though the deeper effects of isolation for Russia, after two decades of integrating with the global economy, may be harder to predict. As for political impact, they say, if the goal of sanctions is to turn Russians against their hyper-popular president, or force Moscow to accept the Western agenda for Ukraine, a very long wait might be in store.\n\nSo far Russia's official response to the tough new measures is to warn the West that there will be painful blowback on US and European business interests for any harm done to Russia. The Kremlin is also insisting that the Western economic offensive will prompt Russians to rally round their leaders.\n\nBut behind that public front, Russian business leaders acknowledge that the new sanctions will bite more deeply than the previous waves, which punished only selected individuals and companies. The new round \"will obviously have a considerable adverse effect on GDP growth,\" says Andrei Klepach, deputy chairman of the state-owned external trade bank, Vneshekonombank.\n\nEconomists say the new sanctions will hurt Russian state banks and leading companies by blocking their access to Western capital markets. At the very least, that will drive up the cost of borrowing, make it difficult for them to roll over their debts \u2013 the Russian private sector owes over $700 billion to foreign investors \u2013 and to obtain financing for new projects. Last weekend, Russia's Central Bank raised its interest rate to a whopping 8 percent, a preemptive move designed to bolster the ruble, but one that will jack up costs throughout Russia's consumer economy.\n\nHowever, many add, Western sources of cash are no longer the only show in town, and that Russia may turn to capital markets in Asia and the Persian Gulf.\n\n\"Russia has no short-term shortage of capital. It sits on big liquidity cushions,\" such as nearly half-a-trillion dollars in foreign reserves, and has vast reserves of natural resources, says Vladimir Osakovsky, a macroeconomist with the Bank of America-Merill Lynch in Moscow.\n\n\"In the longer term, there are alternative markets where capital can be raised. But Western sanctions will increase the difficulties, and hence the costs of doing so,\" he adds. \"It will tell on long-range growth prospects.\"\n\nRussian economists also say the government, which has maintained a balanced budget for many years, may step in by loosening its fiscal policies and introducing stimulus programs to keep Russians employed, and encourage more domestic business growth.\n\n\"I think we will see more policies that increase state investment, especially in infrastructure. It means that we'll run a budget deficit, but that's not necessarily tragic,\" says Alexei Vedev, an economist with the liberal Gaidar Institute in Moscow.\n\nThe other major way the sanctions will bite is by denying Russia access to sensitive and dual-use Western technologies, which are important for Arctic oil-and-gas development and big infrastructure projects planned by the Russian government.\n\n\"Russia needs technology transfer, and this means from Western countries mainly,\" say Mr. Osakovsky. \"There's no short-term impact. In the longer term it can determine growth, or no growth for Russia. But for now, our problems look quite manageable.\"\n\nPredictions of Mr. Putin's political demise may also be premature, experts say.\n\nSo far, the Russian public has barely noticed the sanctions threat. In early March, when sanctions were first imposed over Russia's annexation of Crimea, more than half of Russians admitted to being worried about it, while 40 percent said they weren't, says Alexei Grazhdankin, deputy director of the Levada Center in Moscow, Russia's only independent polling agency. By July, only 36 percent said they were worried, while 61 percent said they weren't.\n\n\"It seems that the development of events actually calmed people down. So far, the majority have only heard about sanctions from the media, which tends to take the optimistic line that it will only strengthen us,\" says Mr. Grazhdankin. \"Still, a clear majority says that they are not worried.\"\n\nRussian elites, who've grown used to doing business and parking their assets in the West, are agitated, say experts. But most may see little alternative to rallying around the Kremlin amid a wave of public patriotism.\n\n\"In some way the sanctions may play into Putin's hands, by forcing the richest Russians to bring their money home and show solidarity, or else lose their political influence and economic monopolies inside Russia,\" says Nikolai Petrov, a professor at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow.\n\nBut he adds that the vast ranks of the middle bureaucracy, who actually run Russia and have been pampered by Putin in recent years, are already being constrained by disciplinary measures \u2013 including travel bans imposed by the Kremlin on huge numbers of police and security personnel.\n\n\"Many mid-level officials have grown used to a certain lifestyle, and the Kremlin's preemptive measures aimed at insulating them from Western exposure are already crimping those lifestyles,\" he says. \"It's a matter of having gotten used to vacations in Europe, sending their kids to school abroad, maybe buying a holiday property somewhere, and having it taken away.\"\n\nStill, any serious rift in the upper ranks around Putin is hard to see at the moment.\n\n\"The population is being consolidated by these events,\" says Valery Mironov, deputy director of the Center for Development at Moscow's Higher School of Economics. \"Russians always seem unite and work together in the face of a foreign threat. It's like we always have to be struggling against somebody to get things done.\"", "html": null, "created_at": 1406678608.207999, "image": "http://www.csmonitor.com/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/content/2014/0729-osanctions/18785309-1-eng-US/0729-osanctions.jpg", "title": "As EU, US unveil biting new sanctions, Russia ready to soldier on", "feed_id": 10, "updated_at": 1418345124.718693, "source_id": 4, "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2014/0729/As-EU-US-unveil-biting-new-sanctions-Russia-ready-to-soldier-on", "id": 7713}, {"text": "Though Western new sanctions on finance, energy, and other sectors will hinder Russia's long-term growth, economists say, the country will not suffer any short-term effects.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov speaks during a news conference in Moscow on Monday.

Last weekend, Russia's Central Bank raised its interest rate to a whopping 8 percent, a preemptive move designed to bolster the ruble, but one that will jack up costs throughout Russia's consumer economy.\n\nHowever, many add, Western sources of cash are no longer the only show in town, and that Russia may turn to capital markets in Asia and the Persian Gulf.\n\n\"Russia has no short-term shortage of capital. It sits on big liquidity cushions,\" such as nearly half-a-trillion dollars in foreign reserves, and has vast reserves of natural resources, says Vladimir Osakovsky, a macroeconomist with the Bank of America-Merill Lynch in Moscow.\n\n\"In the longer term, there are alternative markets where capital can be raised. But Western sanctions will increase the difficulties, and hence the costs of doing so,\" he adds. \"It will tell on long-range growth prospects.\"\n\nRussian economists also say the government, which has maintained a balanced budget for many years, may step in by loosening its fiscal policies and introducing stimulus programs to keep Russians employed, and encourage more domestic business growth.\n\n\"I think we will see more policies that increase state investment, especially in infrastructure. It means that we'll run a budget deficit, but that's not necessarily tragic,\" says Alexei Vedev, an economist with the liberal Gaidar Institute in Moscow.\n\nThe other major way the sanctions will bite is by denying Russia access to sensitive and dual-use Western technologies, which are important for Arctic oil-and-gas development and big infrastructure projects planned by the Russian government.\n\n\"Russia needs technology transfer, and this means from Western countries mainly,\" say Mr. Osakovsky. \"There's no short-term impact. In the longer term it can determine growth, or no growth for Russia. But for now, our problems look quite manageable.\"\n\nPredictions of Mr. Putin's political demise may also be premature, experts say.\n\nSo far, the Russian public has barely noticed the sanctions threat. In early March, when sanctions were first imposed over Russia's annexation of Crimea, more than half of Russians admitted to being worried about it, while 40 percent said they weren't, says Alexei Grazhdankin, deputy director of the Levada Center in Moscow, Russia's only independent polling agency. By July, only 36 percent said they were worried, while 61 percent said they weren't.\n\n\"It seems that the development of events actually calmed people down. So far, the majority have only heard about sanctions from the media, which tends to take the optimistic line that it will only strengthen us,\" says Mr. Grazhdankin. \"Still, a clear majority says that they are not worried.\"\n\nRussian elites, who've grown used to doing business and parking their assets in the West, are agitated, say experts. But most may see little alternative to rallying around the Kremlin amid a wave of public patriotism.\n\n\"In some way the sanctions may play into Putin's hands, by forcing the richest Russians to bring their money home and show solidarity, or else lose their political influence and economic monopolies inside Russia,\" says Nikolai Petrov, a professor at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow.\n\nBut he adds that the vast ranks of the middle bureaucracy, who actually run Russia and have been pampered by Putin in recent years, are already being constrained by disciplinary measures \u2013 including travel bans imposed by the Kremlin on huge numbers of police and security personnel.\n\n\"Many mid-level officials have grown used to a certain lifestyle, and the Kremlin's preemptive measures aimed at insulating them from Western exposure are already crimping those lifestyles,\" he says. \"It's a matter of having gotten used to vacations in Europe, sending their kids to school abroad, maybe buying a holiday property somewhere, and having it taken away.\"\n\nStill, any serious rift in the upper ranks around Putin is hard to see at the moment.\n\n\"The population is being consolidated by these events,\" says Valery Mironov, deputy director of the Center for Development at Moscow's Higher School of Economics. \"Russians always seem unite and work together in the face of a foreign threat. It's like we always have to be struggling against somebody to get things done.\"", "html": null, "created_at": 1406703851.299999, "image": "http://www.csmonitor.com/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/content/2014/0729-osanctions/18785309-1-eng-US/0729-osanctions.jpg", "title": "As EU, US unveil biting new sanctions, Russia ready to soldier on (+video)", "feed_id": 10, "updated_at": 1406703851.299999, "source_id": 4, "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2014/0729/As-EU-US-unveil-biting-new-sanctions-Russia-ready-to-soldier-on-video", "id": 7929}], "story_id": 8, "created_at": 1406678608.207999}, {"articles": [{"text": "The United States and the European Union unveiled new sets of economic sanctions against Russia and threatened to ratchet them up even further if Russian strongman Vladimir Putin continues to support separatists in Ukraine. Behind the tough talk, however, is a careful set of measures with so many loopholes that they are unlikely to hobble the Russian economy.\n\nThe coordinated moves by Washington and Brussels began Tuesday, when European leaders took their broadest swipe yet at key sectors of the Russian economy and announced measures designed to block Russian banks from using the continent's capital markets, curtail the export of oil industry equipment, and ban member countries from signing new defense contracts with Russia. But the EU left some loopholes large enough to send a couple of giant warships through, as the French government still plans to do. Also left largely untouched was Russia's all-powerful gas industry.\n\nHours later, President Barack Obama announced new sanctions designed to match the EU move, keeping Russian oil companies from buying Western firms' technology to extract its hard-to-reach deep-sea and shale oil reserves. It's unclear whether that prohibition will hit existing energy contracts.\n\nThe new European sanctions go further than ever before but still fall short of the type of \"sectoral sanctions\" that would block business with entire Russian industries. That reflects EU leaders' concerns that hitting Russia too hard would also hurt their own companies and industries. The arms embargo, for instance, doesn't apply to existing agreements. That means the $1.6 billion French deal to sell Mistral warships to Russia, which had come under fire from British officials last week, will be allowed to go forward, though France has said it will only deliver the first one while re-evaluating whether to also deliver the second.\n\nThat's not the only sacred cow left untouched. While the new coordinated measures target future oil production, they don't touch the natural gas business, a pillar of Russia's export economy and a lifeline for Europeans. Both the United States and Europe took steps to restrict trade in key oil industry equipment needed for extracting oil from deep waters, in the Arctic, and from shale -- all areas where Russia hopes to boost its oil output in years to come. The U.S. Commerce Department said it will limit the export of crucial oil technology to Russia, but it is not yet clear exactly what goods and services will be banned, how that will affect Russia's current oil production, or even how much U.S. and European firms will be hit by export bans on certain oil projects.\n\nBut in theory, the measures could put the pinch on Russian energy production in years to come: Russia needs to increase output by about 1.5 million barrels per day by the end of the decade to compensate for declining production at old fields. Tapping tight oil could be the key -- but that requires lots of oil-field services, such as drilling rigs, which the country does not have, despite efforts by state-owned Rosneft and others to bolster Russia's domestic oil-field services sector. Russia could also turn to other countries, such as China, for energy technology. Putin has already proven adept at finding other customers in the midst of the battle with Europe, such as a mammoth $400 billion natural gas deal with China that will diversify Russia's energy exports.\n\nEU nations may also be able to buy certain military equipment from Russia to help maintain existing tanks and weapons bought from Moscow, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal. That could keep the measures from taking too much of a bite out of the Russian defense industry.\n\nThe Obama administration, for its part, moved to shut three more Russian financial institutions -- VTB Bank, Bank of Moscow, and Russian Agricultural Bank -- out of U.S. capital markets. The move doesn't block Americans from dealing with the banks entirely, but expands an earlier list of banks that are prohibited from seeking medium- and long-term financing from U.S. investors. The targeted Russian banks now make up 30 percent of the Russian banking sector, by assets, according to an Obama administration official. The United States also added a navy shipbuilder, the government-owned United Shipbuilding Corporation, to its list of blacklisted defense companies, barring American companies and individuals from dealing with them.\n\nObama said the new U.S. measures would further weaken an already wobbly Russian economy. Russian economic growth was already down heading into 2014, but the combination of Moscow's foray into Ukraine and the threat of sanctions has driven economic forecasts down further. Economists say Russia could see $100-$150 billion in capital outflow this year, with growth close to zero.\n\nThe EU's turn toward targeting industries comes amid growing evidence that Putin is escalating his support for pro-Russian separatists inside Ukraine. U.S. officials believe that the rebels used a Russian-provided anti-aircraft missile to down a civilian airplane, killing all of the nearly 300 passengers on board. American officials say that Putin has moved 15,000 troops to its border with Ukraine in recent weeks and fired into the country from positions inside Russia.\n\n\"The package of new restrictive measures agreed today by the European Union constitutes a powerful signal to the leaders of the Russian Federation: destabilizing Ukraine, or any other eastern European neighboring state, will bring heavy costs to its economy,\" Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council, said in a statement. The details of the EU measures are expected to be published Thursday, which is when they will go into effect.\n\nStill, the big unknown in the West's sanctions equation is how far the United States and its allies would need to go to force Putin, whose popularity has soared since the Ukrainian crisis began, to change course.

Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the creation of sweeping agricultural counter-sanctions against countries that supported the West's sanctions on Russia. The Kremlin had already imposed individual import bans against Western agriculture, including Polish apples.\n\nAfter pledging that Moscow would not respond \"tit for tat\" to sweeping sanctions imposed against Russia last week by the European Union and the US, President Vladimir Putin has ordered his government to work up a list of retaliatory measures to strike back with.\n\nOver the past week Russia has enacted a list of \"stealthy\" counter-sanctions, including bans on fruits, vegetables, and meat products. They are not being called sanctions, but justified on grounds of \"phytosanitation\" concerns and enforced by Rosselkhoznadzor, the Russian government's veterinary and sanitary watchdog.\n\nThe agency has discovered an apparent outbreak of mad cow disease in Romanian beef, insects in Greek fruits, toxic residue in Spanish meat, and last Friday banned almost all Polish fruits and vegetables \u2013 the Russian market is worth $1.3 billion annually for Poland \u2013 because of \"repeated violations\" of food safety certificates. Citing similar concerns, Russia earlier halted a wide spectrum of Ukrainian agricultural imports, amid a general collapse in trading relations between the two former partners.\n\nBut on Wednesday Mr. Putin dropped all pretenses and ordered the government to impose counter-sanctions to prohibit \"the import of certain kinds of agricultural products, raw materials and food originating in a country that has imposed economic sanctions against Russian companies and (or) individuals or has joined such sanctions.\"\n\nMore serious measures might be in the pipeline. According to the Moscow business daily Vedomosti, Moscow might deny European airlines the right to overfly Russian territory, a move that could add significant flight time and fuel costs on far eastern routes. Vedomosti said the measure could cost airlines such as Air France, British Airways, and Lufthansa about $1.3 billion over three months. However, it would also hurt Russia's national airline, Aeroflot, which collects an estimated $300 million annually in overflight fees paid by foreign carriers flying the Siberian route.\n\nRussia might undercut Canada, which has been in the forefront of imposing sanctions, by dumping its bumper wheat crop on world markets this year and sticking Canadian farmers with painful losses, according to one Canadian expert.\n\n\"We're seeing this now because the West has enacted Stage Three sanctions against Russia, and they're starting to bite,\" says Chris Weafer, senior partner at Macro Advisory, a Moscow-based investment consultancy. \"Putin has moved from complaining about Western sanctions to planning retaliatory action. We are not yet at the trigger for more aggressive actions but are certainly close.\"\n\nThe effects of sanctions are so far not visible, but experts say it's only a matter of time before higher borrowing costs lead to higher prices throughout Russia's consumer economy, and the brewing sanctions war brings on shortages of many imported goods that Russians have taken for granted since the collapse of the USSR almost a quarter century ago.\n\nOne of Russia's leading business oligarchs, Putin crony Gennady Timchenko, gave Russians a public glimpse this week of the troubles he has suffered since being placed on sanctions lists by the EU and the US a few months ago.\n\n\"The sanctions make themselves manifest in the most bizarre ways,\" Mr. Timchenko said in a marathon interview with the official ITAR-Tass agency. \"For instance, Gulfstream company has refused to perform its duties under a contract by suspending the flights of my jet, which I had purchased from them for quite some money.... The aircraft is not serviced and is halted to a standstill.\"\n\nAt a Russian government meeting Tuesday, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev admitted that Russia's ability to raise money on Western capital markets is \"not good\" due to sanctions, and said that next year's state budget will have take into account the \"negative impact\" of sanctions on individual Russian companies and the economy as a whole.\n\nMr. Medvedev hinted that the government might let go of the strict balanced-budget policy it has pursued for many years, and start spending money to compensate Russians who've suffered from sanctions, to stimulate industries to start making things that were formerly imported, and to reorient the Russian economy away from its technology and capital dependency on the West.\n\n\"We will have to more actively engage in import substitution and support our high-tech industries, including the nuclear industry, aerospace, and others. In any case, no matter what happens, there is no question that we will continue to move forward, implement programs and projects of national significance,\" he said.\n\nIn the long-term, experts say, Russia could turn to Asia \u2013 where cloned US high-tech goods are available \u2013 to make up for some of the technological and dual-use goods that Western sources must now deny to Russian companies. The Moscow daily Izvestia reported Wednesday that quite a few military and aerospace components needed by Russia, not to mention consumer goods like smart phones, can be found in China.\n\nFruits and vegetables formerly purchased from Ukraine, Poland, and other EU countries might be replaced with supplies from former Soviet countries like Armenia and Azerbaijan, as well as Turkey.

They are not being called sanctions, but justified on grounds of \"phytosanitation\" concerns and enforced by Rosselkhoznadzor, the Russian government's veterinary and sanitary watchdog.\n\nThe agency has discovered an apparent outbreak of mad cow disease in Romanian beef, insects in Greek fruits, toxic residue in Spanish meat, and last Friday banned almost all Polish fruits and vegetables \u2013 the Russian market is worth $1.3 billion annually for Poland \u2013 because of \"repeated violations\" of food safety certificates. Citing similar concerns, Russia earlier halted a wide spectrum of Ukrainian agricultural imports, amid a general collapse in trading relations between the two former partners.\n\nBut on Wednesday Mr. Putin dropped all pretenses and ordered the government to impose counter-sanctions to prohibit \"the import of certain kinds of agricultural products, raw materials and food originating in a country that has imposed economic sanctions against Russian companies and (or) individuals or has joined such sanctions.\"\n\nMore serious measures might be in the pipeline. According to the Moscow business daily Vedomosti, Moscow might deny European airlines the right to overfly Russian territory, a move that could add significant flight time and fuel costs on far eastern routes. Vedomosti said the measure could cost airlines such as Air France, British Airways, and Lufthansa about $1.3 billion over three months. However, it would also hurt Russia's national airline, Aeroflot, which collects an estimated $300 million annually in overflight fees paid by foreign carriers flying the Siberian route.\n\nRussia might undercut Canada, which has been in the forefront of imposing sanctions, by dumping its bumper wheat crop on world markets this year and sticking Canadian farmers with painful losses, according to one Canadian expert.\n\n\"We're seeing this now because the West has enacted Stage Three sanctions against Russia, and they're starting to bite,\" says Chris Weafer, senior partner at Macro Advisory, a Moscow-based investment consultancy. \"Putin has moved from complaining about Western sanctions to planning retaliatory action. We are not yet at the trigger for more aggressive actions but are certainly close.\"\n\nThe effects of sanctions are so far not visible, but experts say it's only a matter of time before higher borrowing costs lead to higher prices throughout Russia's consumer economy, and the brewing sanctions war brings on shortages of many imported goods that Russians have taken for granted since the collapse of the USSR almost a quarter century ago.\n\nOne of Russia's leading business oligarchs, Putin crony Gennady Timchenko, gave Russians a public glimpse this week of the troubles he has suffered since being placed on sanctions lists by the EU and the US a few months ago.\n\n\"The sanctions make themselves manifest in the most bizarre ways,\" Mr. Timchenko said in a marathon interview with the official ITAR-Tass agency. \"For instance, Gulfstream company has refused to perform its duties under a contract by suspending the flights of my jet, which I had purchased from them for quite some money.... The aircraft is not serviced and is halted to a standstill.\"\n\nAt a Russian government meeting Tuesday, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev admitted that Russia's ability to raise money on Western capital markets is \"not good\" due to sanctions, and said that next year's state budget will have take into account the \"negative impact\" of sanctions on individual Russian companies and the economy as a whole.\n\nMr. Medvedev hinted that the government might let go of the strict balanced-budget policy it has pursued for many years, and start spending money to compensate Russians who've suffered from sanctions, to stimulate industries to start making things that were formerly imported, and to reorient the Russian economy away from its technology and capital dependency on the West.\n\n\"We will have to more actively engage in import substitution and support our high-tech industries, including the nuclear industry, aerospace, and others. In any case, no matter what happens, there is no question that we will continue to move forward, implement programs and projects of national significance,\" he said.\n\nIn the long-term, experts say, Russia could turn to Asia \u2013 where cloned US high-tech goods are available \u2013 to make up for some of the technological and dual-use goods that Western sources must now deny to Russian companies. The Moscow daily Izvestia reported Wednesday that quite a few military and aerospace components needed by Russia, not to mention consumer goods like smart phones, can be found in China.\n\nFruits and vegetables formerly purchased from Ukraine, Poland, and other EU countries might be replaced with supplies from former Soviet countries like Armenia and Azerbaijan, as well as Turkey. Meat products previously purchased from sanctions hawks like the US and Canada could be offset by imports from Latin America, like Brazil and Argentina.\n\n\"It's long been acknowledged that Russia could produce a lot of things for itself that it currently imports,\" says Mr. Weafer. \"But there is no doubt that if it goes on much longer, or sanctions are ratcheted up, real damage is going to be done.

Brennan also ordered the creation of an internal personnel board, led by former senator Evan Bayh (D-Ind.), to review the agency employees' conduct and determine \"potential disciplinary measures.\"\n\nMembers of the Senate Intelligence Community expressed vindication but some made clear that their animosity toward Brennan persists. Sen. Mark Udall (D-Colo.) called for Brennan's resignation. He said he had \"lost confidence\" in the director, citing \"the unprecedented hacking of congressional staff computers,\" damaging leaks about the committee's interrogation probe and Brennan's \"abject failure to acknowledge any wrongdoing by the agency.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest said Obama supports Brennan and disputed that the CIA director's reversal on the clash with Congress had damaged his credibility. \"Not at all,\" Earnest said, noting that Brennan had initiated the inspector general's review.\n\n\"He currently is operating in a very difficult environment to ensure the safety of the American public,\" Earnest said. \"He is somebody who has a very difficult job, who does that job extraordinarily well.\"\n\nBrennan's apology to lawmakers was in sharp contrast to the defiant position he took when the dispute first surfaced publicly in March. At the time, he warned that lawmakers would regret accusing the agency of wrongdoing.\n\n\"When the facts come out on this, I think a lot of people who are claiming that there has been this tremendous sort of spying and monitoring and hacking will be proved wrong,\" he said.\n\nBrennan was responding to accusations from Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and others that the CIA had secretly removed documents from committee computers and attempted to intimidate investigators by requesting an FBI inquiry of their conduct.\n\nFeinstein described the conflict as a \"defining moment\" for congressional oversight of spy agencies and cited concerns that the CIA had \"violated the separation-of-powers principles embodied in the United States Constitution.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Feinstein said she had been briefed by Buckley and she described Brennan's apology and decision to convene a personnel board as \"positive first steps,\" adding, \"This IG report corrects the record.\" Buckley is a former congressional aide.\n\nAs the standoff between the CIA and the committee intensified, Robert Eatinger, a senior lawyer for the CIA, issued a referral to the Justice Department asking for an investigation of whether committee staff members had committed a crime by extracting sensitive documents that the agency hadn't agreed to turn over.\n\nThe Justice Department closed that inquiry on July 9 after finding insufficient evidence that either side had committed a crime, according to the summary of the inspector general's findings. But it also appeared to call attention to another agency misstep.\n\nThe allegations that the CIA called to the attention of the Justice Department were \"not supported,\" Buckley said, \"as the author of the referral had been provided inaccurate information on which the letter was based.\"\n\nEatinger, a longtime agency lawyer who was involved in legal issues surrounding the interrogation program, is mentioned by name in the Senate committee's report hundreds of times, said officials familiar with the document.\n\nThe agency declined to identify the 10 employees cited in the inspector general's report, but noted that Brennan was not accused of any wrongdoing. The search of the committee's computers was carried out by the CIA's Office of Security.\n\nThe inspector general's summary noted that its investigation was limited to the conduct of agency officers, and not that of congressional staff members.

Dianne Feinstein and Saxby Chambliss.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2014 NPR. For personal, noncommercial use only. See Terms of Use. For other uses, prior permission required.\n\nAnd now we're turning to another story on Capitol Hill involving the CIA and an apology. That apology came today from CIA director John Brennan. An internal CIA probe concluded the agency went too far in its spying by snooping on computers used by the Senate Intelligence Committee. To tell us about that story, we're joined by NPR national security correspondent David Welna. Hi, David.\n\nSHAPIRO: Why would the CIA search the computer of the committee that oversees it in the first place?\n\nWELNA: Well, you know, Ari, this all happened in the context of the Senate intelligence committee putting together a massive report on the CIA's use after the 9/11 attacks of waterboarding and other interrogation techniques widely seen as torture. The CIA had insisted that staffers from the Senate committee travel to a CIA secure room to review millions of internal CIA documents from that era. The committee, for its part, insisted that it be given a computer network completely segregated from the CIA's system. CIA IT specialists could access it, but only to do technical support.\n\nSHAPIRO: OK. So the computers we're talking about were not on Capitol Hill and were not at the CIA, but rather at an off-site third location.\n\nWELNA: Right, at a location in Northern Virginia. Now, one document that the committee had - and it's not clear how it got it - was a review of the interrogation program done for former CIA director Leon Panetta. And it was apparently quite damning.\n\nDiane Fienstien, the Dem. who chairs the committee, went to the Senate floor in early March. And there, she angrily accused the CIA of having broken into her staff's computers in search of that document. She's said, Director Brennan and the agency may well have violated the constitutional separation of powers in doing so.\n\nSENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN: I have asked for an apology and a recognition that this CIA search of computers used by its oversight committee was an appropriate.\n\nSHAPIRO: So today, we've given away the punchline that Brennan apologized. But back then, in March - describe how he responded.\n\nWELNA: Well, he said that the charges were basically baseless. Here's Brennan just a couple of hours after Feinstein's broadside on the Senate floor.\n\nJOHN BRENNAN: As far as the allegations of, you know, CIA hacking into, you know, Senate computers, nothing could be further than the truth. I mean, we wouldn't do that. I mean, that's just beyond, you know, the scope of reason.\n\nWELNA: Meanwhile, the CIA was pushing the Justice Department to look into whether Senate intelligence committee staffers took the so-called Panetta Review out of the CIA safe room. Feinstein said, this was all being done just to intimidate her committee. And earlier this month, the Justice Department decided not to pursue the matter any further.\n\nSHAPIRO: And that brings us to the present day, when CIA Director Brennan has done an about-face, admitted there was improper activity by the CIA in this case, apologized to Senator Feinstein. So what changed?\n\nWELNA: Well, Brennan promised back in March that he would have the CIA inspector general look into the whole matter and prepare a report on his findings. And today, a CIA spokesman issued a statement saying, the inspector general's probe found that, in fact, some CIA employees had violated the agreement that the agency would not snoop into the committee's computer system. The spokesman added that CIA Director Brennan told Chairman Fienstien and Saxby Chambliss, the panel's top Rep., about that finding and apologized for it. He's also setting up what's being called an accountability board to recommend what disciplinary steps the CIA should take.\n\nSHAPIRO: OK, David. So this whole dispute - the back and forth, the accusation, the denial, the apology - is all about this so-called torture report that the Senate Intelligence Committee did. When will that be made public?\n\nWELNA: Well, you know, it was finished more than a year and half ago and approved by the committee, and only a long executive summary has been approved for release. The CIA's been busy blacking out parts of that summary for months, but any day now, we could be seeing that redacted version get released. It's expected to say those interrogation methods actually yielded very little useful information and that CIA repeatedly misrepresented its actions.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2014 NPR. All rights reserved.

His defiant posture quickly collapsed after a devastating report by his own inspector general sided against the CIA on each key point of the dispute with the Senate.\n\nAccording to an unclassified summary of the report released Thursday, five agency employees \u2014 two lawyers and three computer specialists\u2014 improperly accessed Intelligence Committee computers earlier this year during a disagreement over interrogation documents. Then, despite Brennan ordering a halt to that operation, the CIA's office of security began an unauthorized investigation that led it to review the emails of Senate staffers and search them for key words.\n\nAfter Senate leaders learned about the intrusion in January and protested, the CIA made a criminal referral to the Justice Department, alleging improper behavior by Senate staffers. That referral, CIA inspector general David Buckley found, was based on inaccurate information and was not justified.\n\nWhen internal investigators interviewed three CIA computer specialists, they exhibited \"a lack of candor,\" the IG report said.\n\nThose devastating internal conclusions prompted Brennan to abandon his defensive posture and apologize to Intelligence Committee leaders.\n\n\"The director said that wherever the investigation led, he would accept the findings and own up to them,\" said his spokesman, Dean Boyd, describing what has become a difficult moment for the nation's most prominent spy agency.\n\nBrennan has convened an internal accountability board chaired by former Sen. Evan Bayh, D-Ind., to examine whether any CIAofficers should be disciplined.\n\nFurious Senate Democrats were unmoved, with some demanding further investigation and a public accounting from Brennan. By all accounts, the spying flap and the larger dispute over decade-old CIA interrogation practices have poisoned relations between key Democrats and the CIA.\n\nTwo Intelligence Committee Democrats, Sens. Mark Udall of Colorado and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, called on Brennan to resign.\n\n\"I just don't have a lot of confidence in his leadership,\" Heinrich said in an interview after leaving a briefing on the IG report.\n\n\"What's needed now is a public apology from Director Brennan to staff and the committee, a full accounting of how this occurred and a commitment there will be no further attempts to undermine congressional oversight of CIA activities,\" said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., an Intelligence Committee member.\n\n\"The investigation confirmed what I said on the Senate floor in March \u2014 CIA personnel inappropriately searched Senate Intelligence Committee computers in violation of an agreement we had reached, and I believe in violation of the constitutional separation of powers,\" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who chairs the committee, said in a statement.\n\nAt issue was a January search by agency officers of Senate computers for information gathered in the course of a Senate investigation into the CIA's interrogation techniques. The search involved a penetration of the Senate portion of a shared, classified computer network at a Northern Virginia facility that was being used to provide Senate aides access to millions of CIA documents.\n\nThe fruits of the Senate's yearslong inquiry \u2014 a summary of a classified report on post-9/11 detentions and interrogations that accuses the CIA of misconduct \u2014 is expected to be made public soon.\n\nThe CIA conducted the search after it began to suspect that Senate aides had obtained a draft internal review that the CIAbelieved the Senate was not entitled to see. The review included comments from CIA officers describing misgivings about the treatment of al-Qaida detainees.\n\nAs it turned out, the Senate staffers got the review thanks to a glitch in the CIA's firewall, several officials said.\n\nThe findings of the investigation by the CIA's inspector general were shared with the Justice Department, which declined to pursue criminal charges against the CIA employees, officials said.\n\nThe inspector general concluded \"that some CIA employees acted in a manner inconsistent with the common understanding\" about the shared computer network, Boyd said.\n\nBoyd said there was no malicious intent behind the actions of CIA officers. He said they were trying to determine how privileged agency documents ended up on the Senate side of the CIA network and whether there was a security breach.\n\nThe CIA is generally forbidden from conducting operations on U.S. soil. One reason no criminal charges were filed, said a Senate aide who was not authorized to speak publicly and requested anonymity, is that the Senate computers were on a CIA network subject to agency monitoring.

His defiant posture quickly collapsed after a devastating report by his own inspector general sided against the CIA on each key point of the dispute with the Senate.\n\nAccording to an unclassified summary of the report released Thursday, five agency employees \u2014 two lawyers and three computer specialists\u2014 improperly accessed Intelligence Committee computers earlier this year during a disagreement over interrogation documents. Then, despite Brennan ordering a halt to that operation, the CIA's office of security began an unauthorized investigation that led it to review the emails of Senate staffers and search them for key words.\n\nAfter Senate leaders learned about the intrusion in January and protested, the CIA made a criminal referral to the Justice Department, alleging improper behavior by Senate staffers. That referral, CIA inspector general David Buckley found, was based on inaccurate information and was not justified.\n\nWhen internal investigators interviewed three CIA computer specialists, they exhibited \"a lack of candor,\" the IG report said.\n\nThose devastating internal conclusions prompted Brennan to abandon his defensive posture and apologize to Intelligence Committee leaders.\n\n\"The director said that wherever the investigation led, he would accept the findings and own up to them,\" said his spokesman, Dean Boyd, describing what has become a difficult moment for the nation's most prominent spy agency.\n\nBrennan has convened an internal accountability board chaired by former Sen. Evan Bayh, D-Ind., to examine whether any CIAofficers should be disciplined.\n\nFurious Senate Democrats were unmoved, with some demanding further investigation and a public accounting from Brennan. By all accounts, the spying flap and the larger dispute over decade-old CIA interrogation practices have poisoned relations between key Democrats and the CIA.\n\nTwo Intelligence Committee Democrats, Sens. Mark Udall of Colorado and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, called on Brennan to resign.\n\n\"I just don't have a lot of confidence in his leadership,\" Heinrich said in an interview after leaving a briefing on the IG report.\n\n\"What's needed now is a public apology from Director Brennan to staff and the committee, a full accounting of how this occurred and a commitment there will be no further attempts to undermine congressional oversight of CIA activities,\" said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., an Intelligence Committee member.\n\n\"The investigation confirmed what I said on the Senate floor in March \u2014 CIA personnel inappropriately searched Senate Intelligence Committee computers in violation of an agreement we had reached, and I believe in violation of the constitutional separation of powers,\" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who chairs the committee, said in a statement.\n\nAt issue was a January search by agency officers of Senate computers for information gathered in the course of a Senate investigation into the CIA's interrogation techniques. The search involved a penetration of the Senate portion of a shared, classified computer network at a Northern Virginia facility that was being used to provide Senate aides access to millions of CIA documents.\n\nThe fruits of the Senate's yearslong inquiry \u2014 a summary of a classified report on post-9/11 detentions and interrogations that accuses the CIA of misconduct \u2014 is expected to be made public soon.\n\nThe CIA conducted the search after it began to suspect that Senate aides had obtained a draft internal review that the CIAbelieved the Senate was not entitled to see. The review included comments from CIA officers describing misgivings about the treatment of al-Qaida detainees.\n\nAs it turned out, the Senate staffers got the review thanks to a glitch in the CIA's firewall, several officials said.\n\nThe findings of the investigation by the CIA's inspector general were shared with the Justice Department, which declined to pursue criminal charges against the CIA employees, officials said.\n\nThe inspector general concluded \"that some CIA employees acted in a manner inconsistent with the common understanding\" about the shared computer network, Boyd said.\n\nBoyd said there was no malicious intent behind the actions of CIA officers. He said they were trying to determine how privileged agency documents ended up on the Senate side of the CIA network and whether there was a security breach.\n\nThe CIA is generally forbidden from conducting operations on U.S. soil. One reason no criminal charges were filed, said a Senate aide who was not authorized to speak publicly and requested anonymity, is that the Senate computers were on a CIA network subject to agency monitoring. But the CIA violated its agreement not to scrutinize the Senate side of the network.\n\nThe summary of the inspector general's report does not say who ordered the CIA search of Senate computers or who conducted it.

Instead of soothing frayed nerves, however, Brennan's remarks left current and former CIA employees wondering if they might face disciplinary actions, public retribution, or even criminal charges.\n\nOne CIA employee asked the director whether individual employees could later find themselves caught in the political crosshairs the next time they're asked to undertake a controversial mission. Brennan seemed \"to dodge the question,\" and his presentation \"went over like a lead balloon,\" said one former intelligence official who spoke to people who attended the town hall meeting. Brennan's talk, which was described as an attempt to allay the anxieties of the workforce before an onslaught of criticism and press attention, \"did not go well,\" a second former intelligence official said. Brennan spoke in an auditorium nicknamed \"the Bubble,\" and his remarks were also carried on an internal CIA closed-circuit television system.\n\nThe meeting comes at an acutely sensitive time for the agency. The administration has finished its review of a nearly 600-page report by the Senate Intelligence Committee, which now has the final decision on when to release the document. That could come as early next week. Brennan and the CIA itself are also facing growing congressional fury over its admission this week that CIA spies improperly accessed Senate computers, a move that leading lawmakers describe as unconstitutional and an abuse of the agency's powers. Some lawmakers have called for Brennan's resignation.\n\nPresident Obama said at the White House Friday that he had \"full confidence\" in Brennan, but he had harsh words for the CIA's interrogation program and the operatives who took part in it. \"We tortured some folks. We did some things that were contrary to our values,\" Obama said.\n\nObama acknowledged that after the 9/11 terrorist attacks there was \"enormous pressure\" on law enforcement and national security personnel to prevent another attack. Obama called many of those personnel \"real patriots.\" Still, he said, \"we did some things that were wrong.\"\n\nThe comments could reignite a simmering political debate about whether any CIA interrogators or senior officials should have faced criminal charges for their treatment of detainees, several of whom died in U.S. custody.\n\nOne of the first executive actions Obama took after winning election in 2008 was to prohibit the CIA from using so-called extraordinary interrogation techniques, which the Senate report describes as torture, according to individuals who have read it. The CIA had abandoned its use of those techniques years earlier. Obama ruled out the idea of pressing charges against any of the CIA personnel, a decision that infuriated many human rights advocates and members of his own party, and that appears not to have assuaged many agency employees.\n\nThe debate over the Bush-era interrogation programs has been dormant for years, but will likely flare up again when the report is made public. With the White House declassifying the report -- which is a truncated version of a much larger 6,000-page document, which will likely never be released -- lawmakers on the Senate Intelligence Committee will now review it for any redactions made by the White House and intelligence officials. That review will take at least a few days, according to sources familiar with the process. But at this point, the Senate committee is free to release the document, which concludes that the CIA didn't glean any intelligence from torture that could prevent a terrorist attack, and that CIA officials misled Congress about the program.\n\nThe release has been partly overshadowed by the controversy over the CIA's interference with the Senate's investigation. Yesterday, the agency confirmed that its inspector general concluded that CIA employees inappropriately monitored the computers of Senate Intelligence Committee staffers who were reviewing millions of classified documents about the interrogation program. Obama said he agreed with the inspector general's finding that some CIA employees acted inappropriately. Brennan apologized to the leaders of the committee, after earlier dismissing any suggestion that the CIA had spied on its congressional overseers.\n\nObama, at least for the moment, is standing by the CIA chief, long one of his closest national security advisers. Brennan worked on then-candidate Obama's presidential campaign in 2008 and was initially his pick to run the CIA. But Brennan withdrew himself from consideration amid questions about his own involvement in the CIA's torture program when he was a senior official at the agency during the George W. Bush administration.", "html": null, "created_at": 1406940360.0, "image": "http://complex.foreignpolicy.com/files/imagecache/860x/cia_2.jpg", "title": "CIA Employees Worry They'll Be Shafted After Torture Report's Release", "feed_id": 46, "updated_at": 1418351255.54972, "source_id": 14, "url": "http://complex.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2014/08/01/cia_employees_worry_theyll_be_shafted_after_torture_reports_release", "id": 10068}, {"text": "An internal CIA report released Thursday included findings that were seen by many as fundamentally at odds with Director John Brennan's public assertions about the case earlier this year. (Carolyn Kaster/AP)\n\nCIA Director John Brennan is regarded by many inside the agency as the most detail-oriented spy chief in a generation, an executive who maintains such tight control of departments and decisions that some subordinates grumble at his reluctance to delegate.\n\nBut the latest rupture in his relationship with Congress has prompted lawmakers to question both his command of elements of his workforce and his command of the facts surrounding their surreptitious search of computers used by congressional investigators.\n\nAn internal CIA report released Thursday included findings that were seen by many as fundamentally at odds with Brennan's public assertions about the case earlier this year when he denied any wrongdoing on the part of the agency. The report found that five CIA employees had improperly searched computer files and read e-mails of Senate investigators probing the agency's use of harsh interrogation measures on terrorism suspects.\n\nThe conclusions of the review are \"not a vote of confidence in the CIA director,\" Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said Friday. Citing the gap between Brennan's previous statements on the matter and the newly disclosed facts, Graham said, \"It makes me wonder what else he doesn't know.\"\n\nWith some lawmakers calling for Brennan's resignation, President Obama declared Friday that he had \"full confidence\" in his CIA director, noting that Brennan had apologized to Senate leaders and had asked for the internal investigation that forced him to admit he had been wrong.\n\nThe criticism of Brennan comes at a critical time for the CIA, just before the expected release of a damning Senate investigation of the agency's interrogation program after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\n\n\"The timing couldn't be worse\" for Brennan, who has indicated that he plans to challenge some of the committee's findings, said a senior U.S. official who has read the interrogation report. \"He needs his credibility. It's not great timing for him to lead a chorus of criticism of the substance\" of the report.\n\nObama said a declassified copy of the report had been delivered to the Senate Intelligence Committee on Friday, putting the panel in position to finally release a report that it has spent the past five years assembling. But Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif), the chairman of the intelligence committee, said the report arrived on Capitol Hill with significant redactions. \"We need additional time to understand the basis for these redactions and determine their justification,\" she said \"Therefore the report will be held until further notice and released when that process is completed.\"\n\nObama denounced the interrogation program, which included the use of waterboarding, during his 2008 presidential campaign and made closing the CIA's secret prisons one of his first moves in office.\n\nAfter the Sept. 11 attacks, \"we did a whole lot of things that were right, but we tortured some folks,\" Obama said. \"I understand why it happened. . . . People did not know whether more attacks were imminent and there was enormous pressure on our law enforcement and national security teams.\"\n\nThe jockeying over the pending release of the Senate report \u2014 and the CIA's admission that it searched the authors' files and e-mails \u2014 have contributed to an odd disconnect between the CIA and the Senate committee charged with overseeing the agency's work.\n\nMost members of the panel are staunch supporters of the agency's current operations, including its controversial campaign of drone strikes. But the relationship between the two sides had deteriorated dramatically over the past year, in large part because of their competing efforts to shape how history regards the interrogation program.\n\nThe tension reflects the extent to which the CIA's actions in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks remain deeply polarizing in Washington and beyond. Brennan, who was a senior executive at the CIA when the interrogation program was launched, faces a particular dilemma.\n\nEndorsing the report's findings would strain his ties with agency veterans, including dozens who still work at CIA and had connections to the interrogation program. Criticizing the report, on the other hand, would risk alienating members of Congress who hold significant sway over his agency and career.\n\nThe committee's 6,000-page report accuses the CIA of systematically misleading government officials on the severity of the methods and their effectiveness. \"You come away with the sense that this was pathetically futile,\" said a senior U.S. official who has read it.\n\nThe latest skirmish between Brennan and the Senate Intelligence Committee reflects the mutual suspicion that accompanied the panel's work.\n\nSen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), a member of the committee, said in an interview Friday that he was troubled that the inspector general report blamed only five CIA employees without making clear who had ordered or approved the secret search.\n\n\"It's not clear to me how exactly the director became aware of this specific intrusion,\" Heinrich said. \"But it's fairly clear to me . . . that the director played a role in setting the tone that would have led people to think this was somehow appropriate.\"\n\nThe case centered on the CIA's effort to determine how the committee obtained a secret document that the agency never intended to share: a draft report that summarized, often in incriminating terms, the contents of documents being turned over to Congress.\n\n\"That effort included a keyword search\" of all the committees' files on a system it shared with the CIA, as well as \"a review of some of the e-mails\" of committee staff, according to the inspector general.\n\nWhen lawmakers accused the agency of hacking into committee files, Brennan shot back during a public appearance that \"nothing could be further from the truth. That's just beyond the . . . you know, the scope of reason in terms of what we would do.\"\n\nU.S. officials said Brennan's remarks have been interpreted too broadly and that his assertions were accurate. The inspector general \"did not find that [the] CIA hacked into Senate computers or that it did so to thwart a Senate investigation,\" a U.S. official said.", "html": null, "created_at": 1406949480.0, "image": "http://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_400w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/08/01/National-Security/Images/CIA_Investigations-08642.jpg?uuid=7vkJEBmfEeSFtsFFHmImNw", "title": "CIA director under fire from lawmakers after agency's search of Senate computers", "feed_id": 15, "updated_at": 1406949480.0, "source_id": 5, "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636635/s/3d1b2133/sc/1/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cworld0Cnational0Esecurity0Ccia0Edirector0Eunder0Efire0Efrom0Elawmakers0Eafter0Eagencys0Esearch0Eof0Esenate0Ecomputers0C20A140C0A80C0A10C3f0A914780E19a90E11e40E9e3b0E7f2f110Ac62650Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Inational/story01.htm", "id": 10121}], "story_id": 9, "created_at": 1406940360.0}, {"articles": [{"text": "A five-year Senate investigation into the CIA's use of torture and other practices that violate international law has US embassies on alert around the world.\n\nIn this June 3, 2014 file photo, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Sen.

John McCain of Arizona told reporters this month. \"In some ways, it's worse than criminal.\" McCain, who was tortured in captivity during the Vietnam War and has been a staunch opponent of torture, is one of several senators calling for a high-level outside investigation, arguing that the CIA's interference with the Senate's work violated \"the fundamental barriers of constitutional authority and responsibility.\"\n\nThe New York Times notes that the report will likely heighten the concerns of US allies abroad that allegedly operated \"black sites\" and carried out some of the CIA interrogations. Though Radio Poland reports that specific countries are unlikely to be named in the report, among those feeling pressure is Poland, where Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was reportedly waterboarded. The Times writes:\n\n\"We have suspected that Polish authorities knew about the black sites and that the C.I.A. had planned for them from the very beginning,\" said Adam Bodnar, vice president of the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights. \"Hopefully, it will allow this issue to be finally resolved, and make sure those in Poland who are guilty are brought to justice.\" The European Court of Human Rights ruled in July that Poland was complicit in the interrogation program and awarded hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages to two men: Abu Zubaydah, suspected of running a Qaeda facility in Pakistan, and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, believed to have planned the attack on the U.S.S. Cole. \"Poland, for all practical purposes, facilitated the whole process, created the conditions for it to happen, and made no attempt to prevent it from occurring,\" the court ruled. Polish officials have steadfastly denied the country was involved in the secret prison program.\n\nRadio Poland notes that \"Poland is conducting an investigation into the allegations, but has been criticized for repeatedly delaying publication of the report.\"", "html": "<html><body><div><div id=\"story-body\" class=\"eza-body clearfix p402_premium\">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p><a href=\"/csmlists/topic/United+States\" title=\"Title: United States\" target=\"_self\" class=\"inform_link\" rel=\"nofollow\">US</a> embassies and military bases abroad are bracing for the expected release today of the Senate's controversial report on the <a href=\"/csmlists/topic/Central+Intelligence+Agency\" title=\"Title: Central Intelligence Agency\" target=\"_self\" class=\"inform_link\" rel=\"nofollow\">CIA</a>'s use of torture during the Bush administration.</p><p>The 480-page document reveals the results of Senate investigation into the CIA's use of torture and other techniques that violate international law against prisoners held on terrorism-related charges.

Reactions elsewhere to the report's findings have been more muted.\n\nThen-Central Intelligence Agency Director Michael Hayden speaks to reporters upon his arrival in the Capitol for a meeting with the House Appropriations Committee's Select Intelligence Oversight Subcommittee hearing on CIA interrogation programs, in Washington, December 13, 2007.\n\nPresident Barack Obama has addressed the Senate Intelligence Committee's report on the CIA's use of torture on detainees after the 9/11 attacks in 2001, saying the methods detailed in the report are \"contrary to who we are.\"\n\nHe told Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz-Balart of Telemundo/MSNBC that some of the events in the report released Tuesday \"constituted torture\" while also saying that CIA interrogators \"do a really tough job and they do it really well.\"\n\nPolitical reaction to the report in the US has broken down along partisan lines: Architects and supporters during the Bush years defend the CIA's practices as having saved lives, and most of the Republicans on the Senate committee dispute its findings. \"We have no doubt that the CIA's detention program saved lives and played a vital role in weakening (al-Qaeda) while the program was in operation,\" six of the seven Republicans on the committee wrote in their dissent.\n\nNearly 10 percent of the report discusses former CIA director Michael Hayden and what it calls his \"inaccurate\" 2007 testimony to the committee. Mr. Hayden had testified that waterboarding was only allowed to be conducted on five days out of 30, and only twice per day in sessions lasting two hours or less. The Senate report found:\n\nMr. Hayden wrote in The Daily Telegraph yesterday that \"the Senate Democrat document reads like a shrill prosecutorial screed rather than a dispassionate historical study.\"\n\nFormer CIA Director George Tenet told 60 Minutes in 2007 that \"we don't torture people.\" He added: \"You know, the image that's been portrayed is we sat around the campfire and said, 'Oh, boy, now we go get to torture people.' We don't torture people. Let me say that again to you, we don't torture people. OK?,\" Tenet told the program.\n\nSpecifically asked if the US had \"waterboarded\" alleged 9/11 planner Khalid Sheikh Mohamed, he said: \"We do not. I don't talk about techniques.\" The Senate report revealed that Mr. Mohamed was subjected to simulated drowning more than 100 times.\n\nIn 2002, Mr. Tenet suggested to then President George W. Bush that CIA interrogators be exempted from the Geneva Conventions. The CIA Office of the Inspector General had written notes on a Sept. 8, 2003 interview with Tenet that he \"believes that if the general public were to find out about the program, many would believe we are torturers.\"\n\nTenet also said that his \"only potential moral dilemma would be if more Americans died at the hand of terrorists,\" and maintained a defense of torture on utilitarian grounds in a Wall Street Journal op-ed yesterday that was also signed by Hayden and Porter Goss, another former CIA director. The men wrote that \"thousands of lives\" had been saved due to intelligence gleaned from Mohamed and Abu Zubaydah, an alleged Al Qaeda operative who was held at a CIA blacksite in Thailand.\n\n\"Once they had become compliant due to the interrogation program, both Abu Zubaydah and KSM turned out to be invaluable sources on the al Qaeda organization,\" they wrote.\n\nThe Senate torture report finds that claims of the effectiveness of the torture program were exaggerated by CIA officials. For instance it writes of an email from a CIA official that claimed \"after the use of enhanced (interrogation techniques), (Abu Zubaydah) grew into what is now our most cooperative detainee\" and \"produced concrete results that helped save lives.\" The Senate authors write on page 192 of the report that \"these representations were almost entirely inaccurate.\"\n\nMr. Zubaydah's CIA interrogators abused him for 17 straight days in August 2002. The report summarizes:\n\nThe use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques - including \"walling, attention grasps, slapping, facial hold, stress positions, cramped confinement, white noise and sleep deprivation\"\u2014 continued in \"varying combinations, 24 hours a day\" for 17 straight days, through August 20, 2002. When Abu Zubaydah was left alone during this period, he was placed in a stress position, left on the waterboard with a cloth over his face, or locked in one of two confinement boxes. According to the cables, Abu Zubaydah was also subjected to the waterboard \"2-4 times a day...with multiple iterations of the watering cycle during each application.\"' ... Over the course of the entire 20 day \"aggressive phase of interrogation,\" Abu Zubaydah spent a total of 266 hours in the large (coffin size) confinement box and 29 hours in a small confinement box... The CIA interrogators told Abu Zubaydah that the only way he would leave the facility was in the coffin-shaped confinement box.\"\n\nFormer Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski has become the country's most senior official to admit that it had hosted one of the CIA's so-called \"black sites,\" where torture was practiced on Al Qaeda suspects. AP reports that he said the Polish government had not authorized the abuse of detainees in 2002 and 2003.\n\nChina and North Korea, two countries where torture is common and that are often criticized by the US government for their human rights records, quickly pounced on the opportunity to fire back at the US. Citing the Senate report and the killing in Ferguson, Missouri of Michael Brown, China's state news agency Xinhua wrote in an editorial that \"America is neither a suitable role model nor a qualified judge on human rights issues in other countries... people rarely hear the US talking about its own problems, preferring to be vocal on the issues it sees in other countries, including China.\"\n\nNorth Korea government mouthpiece KCNA wrote: \"If the UNSC handles the 'human rights issue' in the DPRK [North Korea] while shutting its eyes to the serious human rights issue in the US, one of its permanent members, while failing to settle the pending and urgent issues directly linked with the world peace and security, it will prove itself its miserable position that it has turned into a tool for US arbitrary practices just as everybody can hear everywhere.\"", "html": "<html><body><div><div id=\"story-body\" class=\"eza-body clearfix p402_premium\">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p>President Barack Obama has addressed the Senate Intelligence Committee's report on the <a href=\"/csmlists/topic/Central+Intelligence+Agency\" title=\"Title: Central Intelligence Agency\" target=\"_self\" class=\"inform_link\" rel=\"nofollow\">CIA</a>'s use of torture on detainees after the 9/11 attacks in 2001, saying the methods detailed in the report are \"contrary to who we are.\"</p><p>He <a href=\"http://www.telemundo.com/noticias\" target=\"_self\">told Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz-Balart</a> of Telemundo/MSNBC that some of the events in the report released Tuesday \"constituted torture\" while also saying that CIA interrogators \"do a really tough job and they do it really well.\"\u00a0</p><p>Political reaction to the report in the <a href=\"/csmlists/topic/United+States\" title=\"Title: United States\" target=\"_self\" class=\"inform_link\" rel=\"nofollow\">US</a> has broken down along partisan lines: Architects and supporters during the Bush years defend the CIA's practices as having saved lives, and most of the <a href=\"/csmlists/topic/U.S.+Republican+Party\" title=\"Title: U.S. Republican Party\" target=\"_self\" class=\"inform_link\" rel=\"nofollow\">Republicans</a> on the Senate committee dispute its findings. \"We have no doubt that the CIA's detention program saved lives and played a vital role in weakening (<a href=\"/csmlists/topic/Al+Qaeda\" title=\"Title: Al Qaeda\" target=\"_self\" class=\"inform_link\" rel=\"nofollow\">al-Qaeda</a>) while the program was in operation,\" six of the seven Republicans on the committee wrote <a href=\"http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/study2014/sscistudy3.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">in their dissent</a>.</p><p>Nearly 10 percent of the report discusses former CIA director <a href=\"/csmlists/topic/Michael+Hayden\" title=\"Title: Michael Hayden\" target=\"_self\" class=\"inform_link\" rel=\"nofollow\">Michael Hayden</a> and what it calls his \"inaccurate\" 2007 testimony to the committee.
